# Technical Writing

I admit it: many of these used to be blog posts. This site is definitely not a
blog. I realized I should redesign my site to remove the timestamps before the
most recent blog post was old enough to drink.

## Functional Programming

These in-depth articles use ActionScript 3 as their example language, but the concepts

### [How We Added Time Travel to Paperless Post](/technical-writing/how-we-added-time-travel-to-paperless-post/)

this article has a lot of good chunky technical information that is still useful
today.
