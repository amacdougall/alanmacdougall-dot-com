# Alan MacDougall

## Profile

My name is Alan MacDougall. I am a software developer who lives and works in
NYC. I have experience all up and down the stack, from ReactJS webapps to raw
SQL, and in many ecosystems and languages.

My heart is closer to the server-side than to the front end. I'm happier with
SQL than HTML. I know my way around HTML and CSS, but I prefer to work with a
skilled designer. That said, I like writing application code whether it's an API
or the UI that drives it. I like to write code that is easy to understand and
survives the test of time. To get the most out of me, give me a codebase
smothered in technical debt and let me help you dig out.

I currently work at [Narvar](https://www.narvar.com) as the manager of their
Shopify Returns engineering team.

I worked on [GetFeedback](https://www.getfeedback.com) for the last few years,
before and after it was acquired by SurveyMonkey. I served as a team manager for
four years there.

For six and a half years before that, I worked as a full-stack developer melding
business logic with UI programming in a complex single-page application, the
card design system at the heart of [Paperless
Post](https://www.paperlesspost.com). I am proud to have worked on such a
successful system as part of a skilled team. Some of my contributions are
[summarized here](/professional-work/).

In my spare time, I have written some [technical articles](/technical-writing/)
and hacked on some [side projects](/side-projects/).
