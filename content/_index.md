# Alan MacDougall

## Profile

My name is Alan MacDougall. I am a software developer who lives and works in
NYC. I work mainly in JavaScript and Ruby these days, but I have experience all
up and down the stack, from ReactJS webapps to raw SQL, and in many ecosystems
and languages.

My heart is closer to the server-side than to the front end. I'm happier with
SQL than HTML. I know my way around HTML and CSS, but I prefer to work with a
skilled designer. I like to write code that is easy to understand and survives
the test of time. To get the most out of me, give me a codebase smothered in
technical debt and let me help you dig out.

I worked on [GetFeedback](https://www.getfeedback.com) for the last few years,
before and after it was acquired by SurveyMonkey. Until recently, I was the
engineering manager on the team which handles our most high-value integrations.

For six and a half years before that, I worked as a "middle-end" developer
melding business logic with UI programming in a complex single-page application,
the card design system at the heart of [Paperless
Post](https://www.paperlesspost.com). I am proud to be have worked on such a
successful system as part of a skilled team. Some of my contributions are
[summarized here](/professional-work/).

In my spare time, I have written some [technical articles](/technical-writing/)
and hacked on some [side projects](/side-projects/).

I am not looking for work.
