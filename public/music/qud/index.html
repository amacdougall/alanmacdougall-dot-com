  <h1><em>Seventh Sultan</em>: A Caves of Qud Hip-Hop EP</h1>
  <p>A four-song rap project based on retrofuturistic SF/fantasy indie roguelike <a href="https://www.cavesofqud.com"><em>Caves of Qud</em></a>.</p>

    <h2><em>Seventh Sultan</em></h2>
    <p>Far from the toxic arboreta of his home arcology, a rare unmutated human advertises his mastery of Qud's many hazards through an artform whose lineage, they say, can be traced back to the days of the Eaters: a long series of exaggerated boasts set to a strict rhythm and meter, accompanied by unearthly noises generated by technology whose mathematical simplicity is belied by the complexity of its results. Did he secure musical assistance from the Barathrumites? Or are his claims of robotic collaborators more than facetious braggadocio? The martial training of his homeland is evident in his motions. Can wit and insult truly bring about syzygy any more than a blade and an axe? Can a song be dismissed as a mere "ego trip" in a world where the psychic weight of Ego can distort reality itself?</p>
