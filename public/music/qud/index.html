      <h2><em>Seventh Sultan</em></h2>
      <p>Far from the toxic arboreta of his home arcology, a rare unmutated human advertises his mastery of Qud's many hazards through an artform whose lineage, they say, can be traced back to the days of the Eaters: a long series of exaggerated boasts set to a strict rhythm and meter, accompanied by unearthly noises generated by technology whose mathematical simplicity is belied by the complexity of its results. Did he secure musical assistance from the Barathrumites? Or are his claims of robotic collaborators more than facetious braggadocio? The martial training of his homeland is evident in his motions. What syzygy is brought about by blade and axe? By wit and insult? Can a song be dismissed as a mere "ego trip" in a world where the psychic weight of Ego can distort reality itself?</p>

      <h2><em>Carbide Chef</em></h2>
      <p>These ovens, coolers, pantries, cooktops, sinks, grills, racks, and salamanders were built on the tombstones of water barons who dreamed once of conquest and now sleep without dreams. One baron remains. Her dream was the strongest, and it has come true. What challenger can step into Kitchen Heptagon without fear? Without doubt? Without a moment of reflection on the evanescence of glory, which fades as quickly as dry ice sublimes; of life, whose heat fades no more slowly from a corpse than from a casserole? This question is not rhetorical. The answer is about to arrive.</p>
