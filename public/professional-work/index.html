<p>As manager of the team responsible for third-party integrations in GetFeedback,
I led a team of five developers. I worked with a product manager and a designer
to plan the future of the application. During this time:</p>
<ul>
<li>We created a new Salesforce integration microservice, with an experimental
frontend. It ran within a Kafka-based microservice architecture that hosted an
increasing number of services, as part of an initiative to unify GetFeedback
and another recent acquisition, Usabilla.</li>
<li>We built a contact database for survey response attribution, with an
innovative client-side spreadsheet import system. This system was designed as
the centerpiece of a customer-experience management platform which would
encompass GetFeedback and third-party CRMs.</li>
<li>When Zendesk and SurveyMonkey announced a planned merger, we played a crucial
part in a crash effort to build a Zendesk integration. The merger fell
through, but the Zendesk integration is now available to all customers.</li>
<li>Through it all, we continued to maintain and improve our existing Salesforce
integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were several changes of direction in this period, and so my management
style emphasized stability, medium-term goals, and a clear business rationale
for each effort. My team had excellent retention despite general attrition, and
feedback from my managers and team members emphasized my calm and positive
attitude. (Full disclosure: I was sweating bullets half the time.)</p>
<h2 id="at-getfeedback">
  At GetFeedback
  <a class="anchor" href="#at-getfeedback">#</a>
</h2>
<p>As a full-stack developer on a small team, I had responsibility for every aspect
of the GetFeedback application. Using Rails and JavaScript, I did countless
features and bugfixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>I made many improvements and refinements to the Salesforce integration at the
heart of our business.</li>
<li>I implemented a print-friendly view of one of our main analytics reports, a
surprisingly complex task that got deep into browser-level rendering, and even
saw me analyzing the Chromium source code to understand the graphics pipeline.</li>
<li>I wrote a quick and dirty tool to suggest possible fields for univariate
segmentation, filtering out fields whose datasets were too noisy, too sparse,
too this, too that.</li>
<li>I implemented import and export of spreadsheets for multilanguage
translations. This was a fun job that got me deep into the various specs for
language naming, string encoding, and spreadsheet parsing. I ended up with a
lot of respect for UTF-8.</li>
<li>With a co-worker, I created the Actions feature, which permits customers to
easily generate complex workflows for established use cases. There is now an
entire team working on a similar concept.</li>
<li>I played a large part in integrating Twilio with our existing distribution
methods, permitting SMS survey distribution. Twilio is great! I understand now
why they had billboards all over SF just saying &ldquo;ask your developer.&rdquo;</li>
<li>I did a lot of backend work on our billing and subscription systems. Tax
calculation is hard, and even filling in the gaps in a third-party API was a
real task.</li>
<li>With co-workers, I connected one of our main analytics views to a
live-updating object database instead of Postgres, greatly improving its
responsiveness and filtering abilities.</li>
<li>And amid all this, I fixed countless bugs and did many small features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="at-paperless-post">
  At Paperless Post
  <a class="anchor" href="#at-paperless-post">#</a>
</h2>
<p>From May 2011 to December 2017, I worked on the design tool, the single-page
webapp used to customize cards in <a href="https://www.paperlesspost.com">Paperless Post</a>.
I am proud to have worked with a great team on a complex product that directly
adds value to the lives of our customers.</p>
<p>The second incarnation of that design tool is powered by an embeddable
canvas-based JavaScript module nicknamed &ldquo;the viewport&rdquo;. This module is at the
core of the Paperless Post card system, and powers the React-based desktop web
site, the Redux-based mobile web site, the iOS-based native apps, and the
nodeJS-based server-side renderer.</p>
<h3 id="undoredo">
  Undo/Redo
  <a class="anchor" href="#undoredo">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I wrote a pretty solid undo/redo system for the old Flash/JavaScript hybrid
version of the design tool. I am still proud of it! Some of my finer technical
work. Required a lot of grit to go through and apply it to every aspect of the
application. <a href="/technical-writing/how-we-added-time-travel-to-paperless-post/">This article</a>,
originally from the company tech blog, describes it in detail.</p>
<h3 id="and-everything-else">
  And Everything Else
  <a class="anchor" href="#and-everything-else">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I did a lot of heavy lifting at Paperless Post.</p>
<ul>
<li>In my first months, I proposed and led a refactor of the architecture of the
Flash code behind the card design view.</li>
<li>In my first year, I proposed and led a refactor of the business logic which
tied the Flash and JavaScript design components together. The refactored
business logic still runs in the application today, in an evolved form.</li>
<li>As we developed the HTML5 canvas-based viewport module, a co-worker and I got
elbow-deep in the fine details of text editing, since we had to implement all
text interactions from scratch. Ask me about selection pivot points some time.</li>
<li>Text editing requires a lot of mouse sequences. For instance, to select one
word at a time, you double click and drag before releasing the second mouse
click. JavaScript only gives you <code>mouseDown</code>, <code>mouseMove</code>, and <code>mouseUp</code>.
I wrote an extensive state machine to cover the full range of mouse input.</li>
<li>When we brought the viewport to the desktop web, replacing the old Flash/JS
hybrid application, I proposed the use of React, and designed the
architecture.</li>
<li>I wrote a generalized client-side data model class which implemented an
Observer pattern. The model class supported transactions: we could perform a
lot of model property changes before emitting a single event describing the
batch of updates.</li>
<li>Right before we discontinued the Paper product, I implemented a recipient
addressing feature. Knowing that the feature might not be used in the long
run, I designed the data model so that it would have no impact on the rest of
the database. Although the feature was not especially difficult, I consider
this item an example of my technical judgment.</li>
<li>In my last project at Paperless Post, I worked with an <em>ad hoc</em> team to get
card creation working on mobile browsers. The mobile-web app is pure
JavaScript, hosted on S3, and it communicates with the server&rsquo;s JSON API. I
was pleased to have the opportunity to use Redux on the job, and I was
satisfied to leave the company on a win.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="statistics">

<p>According to git, my 5,376 commits and 494 pull requests add up to 171,332 lines
added, 141,331 lines deleted, across 1,127 unique files in three repositories.</p>
<p>Edit: At the time I left the company, the PR count was over 500. A nice
milestone for a major part of my professional journey.</p>
