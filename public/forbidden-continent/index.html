    <p>Aldea, the Forbidden Continent. Once home to an advanced human
    civilization, Aldea is rich in fertile land and natural resources.
    Ruined cities are common, and often full of technological and
    magical marvels. But Aldea is dangerous. War robots and immortal
    magical monsters still patrol the ruins, attacking anything that
    comes too near.</p>

    <p>The other continents are home to civilizations loosely modeled on
    our world circa 1800. For the last fifty years, Aldea has been
    settled by colonists from the two nearest continents.</p>
    <p>The engine which drives the game world is the steady exploration
    and exploitation of the Forbidden Continent, as more and more
    regions lose their protective forcefields.</p>

    <p>The Europe-like cultures come from Broadland, a continent whose
    many rivers and mountain ranges&mdash;and variety of bickering
    gods&mdash;supported sharp distinctions between cultures for thousands of
    years. Discoveries in Aldea have led to an industrial revolution in
    Broadland. (Loosely based on colonial competition between England,
    France, and Spain in 1600 through 1850.)</p>
    <p>The other major known continent is Centramundi, home to the great
    kingdom of the same name. With long, shallow, easily navigable
    rivers, terrain conducive to high-output rice farming, and the
    protection of a single dominant god, Centramundi developed a single
    continent-spanning state which subjugated all competitors. (Loosely
    based on China. We're basically asking the question "what if China
    colonized Louisiana at the same time England colonized Boston?")</p>
    <p>As magic, science, treasures, and natural resources flow from
    Aldea to the civilized world, and the great powers compete for
    dominance in the new sphere, the social and political fabric of the
    world is tearing at the seams.</p>
    <h2 id="possible-game-types">Possible Game Types</h2>
    <p>These are just some ideas:</p>
    <h3 id="explore-the-west">Explore the West</h3>
    <p>Action-adventure focused on exploring ancient ruins and
    confronting the dangers within. Very much in the Indiana Jones bent,
    but with admixtures of Wild West, colonial/revolutionary era settler
    narrative, and great-power competition. This is the core experience
    the setting is optimized for; everything else that happens in the
    world is backsplash from the events happening at the frontier.</p>

    </figure>
    <h3 id="the-king-of-the-city">The King of the City</h3>
    <p>Pulp drama focused on navigating the tensions of the rapidly
    evolving cities of the eastern coast. Amid the ruins of the ancient
    megacities, a new type of economy and civilization are emerging from
    the union of 1800s and high-tech/high-magic technologies. The great
    powers are competing against each other and against nascent
    revolutionary political currents. Great place to make your
    fortune... or lose your life.</p>
    <h3 id="glory-to-the-red-eagle-andor-golden-sun">Glory to the Red
    Eagle and/or Golden Sun</h3>
    <p>Military action-adventure. As agents of Caledane (or Venetonne),
    work as a special unit to stymy the dastardly plans of those
    imperialistic wretches from Venetonne (or Caledane). Strike behind
    enemy lines, race to recover artifacts from ruins before the other
    guys, even participate in pitched battles against rival armies,
    techno-magical monsters, or rival armies using techno-magical
    monsters.</p>

    <h3 id="the-throne-and-the-sword">The Throne and the Sword</h3>
    <p>Back in Broadland, navigate the rapidly shifting social,
    political, and technological landscape. Stand at the crossroads of
    history, amid protests, strikes, coups, even revolutions.</p>

    <p><em>Unveil the Secrets</em>: as nobles or scholars, you are
    members of a secret society that knows Unspeakable Truths about the
    nature of reality and even about the gods themselves. The
    rediscovery of the Forbidden Continent is your long-promised chance
    to break chains that most cannot even see.</p>

    <h1 id="history">History</h1>
    <p>Ten thousand years ago, mankind had a single advanced
    civilization on the continent of Aldea.</p>
    <p>(The legends all say "ten thousand." Now that they have access to
    Aldea, modern archaeologists are thinking it's probably two or three
    thousand. But time passes differently under the sacred barriers, so
    nobody is sure.)</p>
    <p>But the gods went to war, using weapons of inconceivable might.
    The continent was destroyed, and mankind was driven out to sea. The
    survivors landed on other continents, and founded new civilizations.
    The gods, chastened, resolved never again to fight directly, but to
    pursue their rivalry through the fortunes of their chosen peoples.
    And the father of the gods, Sunmaker, placed sixteen inviolable
    shrines on Aldea, each projecting a holy barrier that would preserve
    the continent as an eternal gravestone to the folly of war. People
    definitely kept having wars, but it's the thought that counts.</p>
    <p>Countries rose and fell, and gods rose to prominence and fell to
    ignominy with them. [i.e. if it's relevant, feel free to make up any
    history you want]</p>
    <p>Today, Broadland is dominated by two great powers, Caledane and
    Venetonne. [Very loosely, think of Caledane as an England
    equivalent, and think of Venetonne as an amalgam of France, Italy,
    and Spain.] But these two powers hold each other in check, and many
    lesser countries thrive or at least survive, either as client states
    or as defensive coalitions.</p>
    <p>Fifty years ago, the barriers on Aldea began to fall. Today, the
    eastern coast of Aldea is fully reclaimed by thriving chains of
    colonial cities under the administration of Caledane and Venetonne
    in the north, Centramundi in the south, and the Mercantile League of
    Telmeria wherever they managed to secure a favorable trade deal.</p>
