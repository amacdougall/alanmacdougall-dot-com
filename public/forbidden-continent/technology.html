    <h2 id="forbidden-knowledge">Forbidden Knowledge</h2>
    <p>Aldea was clearly a literate world. Text is everywhere: chipped
    paint on the sides of buildings, glowing sigils on magical sheets of
    glass, stamped imprints on ancient metal machines, even books, plain
    ink on paper, that were preserved in safes or sealed buildings. By
    the will of the gods, the language spoken by humans has not changed
    since humanity was exiled from Aldea. A wanderer in one of Aldea's
    ruined cities can read noodle shop menus, advertisements for moving
    image stories, office directories, street signs. A scholar can read
    light novels where miracles are the stuff of everyday life, but
    human concerns are the same as ever.</p>
    <p>But wherever the text would have described useful details of the
    ancient magical technology of Aldea, there are only solid black
    rectangles, as if a cosmic hand drew a geometrically perfect
    paintbrush over every line. The legends say, "in the madness of the
    war, reason itself was slain." The leading theory is that one of the
    gods concealed all knowledge, so that if humans ever did return to
    Aldea, they could not repeat the destruction. These black bars are
    jokingly called "god script."</p>

    <aside>
    <p>As a concrete example, one may visit a certain room of the Royal
    Museum in Blueport and see a particularly well-preserved scrying
    glass which plays an ancient drama of Aldea. It is a crime story, in
    which a daring theft is committed entirely by inscribing mystic
    runes on a system of interconnected scrying glasses. The personal
    drama is entirely preserved, told through a series of images in
    which the viewpoint seems to flicker quickly from one perspective to
    the next. An enterprising young arcanasmith is ejected from his
    business by a conniving partner. Against the wishes of his young
    wife, he plots revenge in the form of a theft so clever it will
    never be traced back to him. Naturally, things go poorly, and a
    thrilling series of chases, fights, and tense negotiations
    culminates in a rain-soaked encounter at the very peak of one of the
    impossibly tall towers of what is now Crown City.</p>
    The drama is gripping, the outcome shocking. But at every point, the
    technical details of the systems are hidden: the sound turns to the
    roar of the surf, the scrying-glasses in the drama <em>within</em>
    the scrying glass are shown as dead black rectangles, and pivotal
    portions of the magical theft are obscured entirely.
    </aside>
    <p>A commonplace invention in Aldea is the scrying glass. On
    command, these black glass sheets would come alive with images, like
    a glass slide in a lightbox, but these images would move and speak.
    Some viewing glasses show plays, which have been an invaluable
    window into Aldean life; some appear to be tools, the equivalent of
    an accountant's ledger or a shipmaster's weather station. Most are
    broken. But of those which still exist, unsurprisingly, the glass
    goes black and the sound goes dead whenever a magical secret is
    discussed.</p>
    <p>As a result, mankind has been forced to decipher the ruins alone.
    Everywhere in Aldea, there are remnants of a world where the
    miraculous was commonplace, from ruined factories to everyday
    objects. Even limited knowledge has fueled great technological
    progress in Broadland. Frequently, the mere existence of an artifact
    was enough to inspire an invention.</p>
    <h2 id="industrial-revolution">Industrial Revolution</h2>
    <p>Before Aldea began to open, Broadland and Centramundi had
    clockworks, gunpowder, small-scale steel production&mdash;all the
    precursors of an industrial revolution. Broadland already had
    effective cannons, and the great castles of the past were all rubble
    or museums. But the firearms and ammunition discovered on Aldea led
    to a burst of innovation in small arms, and Broadland armies went
    from armored pikemen to uniformed riflemen in one bloody generation.
    There's a similar story about steam engines, railroads,
    steelworking, and so on. Steam and hydraulics to duplicate some of
    the behavior of magical circuitry.</p>
    <p>From our real-world perspective, you could say Aldea had about a
    50s level of physical technology. No transistors, which means no
    microchips, no smartphones, etc. That's intentional&mdash;if they had
    microchips, it would be impossible for 19th-century tools to tinker
    with the ancient tech! But they supplemented their tech with magic,
    which expanded their abilities in other directions. Leaving the
    details vague so we can just come up with stuff.</p>

    <h3 id="specific-technologies">Specific Technologies</h3>
    <p>In general, if it existed in 1800, assume it exists in this game.
    Don't be afraid to reach forward a bit and grab some magical stuff,
    but check with me first. Magical 1940s-level computer? Cool, there's
    probably one or two in the world. Telegraph? No problem, because
    there's a big infrastructure investment, cables can be laid and cut,
    etc. Cellphones? Let's not.</p>
    <p>Following is an incomplete list of technologies which were
    created after 1800, which are available in this game world:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The germ theory of disease</li>
    <li>Penicillin</li>
    <li>Telegraph (limited deployment)</li>
    <li>The fountain pen</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Technologies I would prefer not to include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Repeating firearms</li>
    <li>Aircraft (other than hot air balloons and simple gliders)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, if something would be cool for a few people, but would
    break the game world if <em>everyone</em> had it, we can say that
    someone was able to repair an ancient item, but not create new ones.
    So there could be dozens or hundreds of rapid-fire laser rifles out
    there, but "dozens or hundreds" isn't enough to revolutionize
    warfare. There could be five or six working hovercraft, but they're
    all used by kings or whatever.</p>
    <h2 id="arcanatech">Arcanatech</h2>
    <p>The ancients evidently used magic as a commonplace tool. They
    created countless devices which combine clockworks, hydraulics, and
    magical circuitry. These devices are called arcanatech.</p>
    <p>Lanterns that shine bright as day at the touch of a button.
    Tool-handles which project a cutting edge or a spinning screwdriver
    in ghostly blue. Small trinkets to cause a flame for lighting
    candles. In Aldea, these are luxury items, available to anyone with
    the cash for it.</p>
    <p>And of course, there are weapons. Rare; but more common as one
    goes west. Guns firing heaven knows what, swords of burning light,
    wristbands that project a bullet-blocking forcefield. Aldea was a
    war zone in the final years of its destruction, and the weapons of
    that war remain.</p>

    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>The only folly greater than
    taking up the weapons of the gods is to lay them back
    down.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Most of these devices have no external controls. Even simple
    devices, like guns, swords, or powered armor, may require a special
    command to activate. The ancients had something called an
    "interface", a complex jeweled apparatus which was evidently
    implanted directly into the brain (yes, you read that right). The
    interface allowed the ancients to control their devices with a mere
    gesture or word. Modern scholars have managed to build crude
    approximations of these interfaces, handheld devices which can
    control arcanatech. But the modern interfaces are unwieldy, slow and
    difficult to use, and calibrating an interface to control an unknown
    device is a feat for an expert.</p>

    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>A nobleman consulting a scrying
    glass in a room extravagantly decorated with arcanatech
    artifacts.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The Arcana skill governs how well a character can use an
    interface. This is an intense mental exercise. Imagine using a
    graphing calculator with no prior knowledge, with a room full of
    people shouting at you for the answer.</p>
    <p>[This skill replaces Electronics in the Savage Worlds skill
    list.]</p>
    <h3 id="arcanasmiths">Arcanasmiths</h3>
    <p>Someone who specializes in the study and repair of ancient
    devices is called an arcanasmith. In the east, where industry is
    dense, and in the west, where arcana are common, an arcanasmith is
    no harder to find than a watchmaker.</p>
    <h3 id="power-and-charging">Power and Charging</h3>
    <p>These devices all use power. Some are recharged by the light of
    the sun, some recharge over time by no means anyone can tell, but
    most take a direction connection to a power source, or power cells
    of a few standard sizes. Cell chargers are common, but of course
    they used infrastructure long since destroyed. Most towns in Aldea
    have at least one charger jury-rigged by some arcanasmith to run off
    wind, water, horsepower, or steam.</p>
    <h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
    <p>Until the reopening of the Forbidden Continent, a "cord" was a
    type of thin rope, and a "cable" was a type of metal rope. The
    ancient texts have brought new uses for common words: everyone knows
    what it means to "plug the power cable into the generator", even if
    the world's greatest minds still argue about what these things are
    and how they work.</p>
    <p>Assume that terms like outlet, plug, socket, port, and adapter
    are well-known just from studying ancient texts. Naturally, the
    technical details that would have been useful in <em>recreating</em>
    these artifacts are redacted.</p>
    <h3 id="conduits-and-runes">Conduits and Runes</h3>
    <p>Ancient cables consist of a thin copper wire wrapped in layers of
    substances which are not well understood. These cables are durable,
    flexible, and waterproof. For years, modern arcanasmiths were unable
    to replicate the behavior of these cables.</p>
    <p>In 1764, a few years after the fall of the Second Barrier,
    explorers found a fully functional power plant in a city called the
    House of Light. (See <a
    href="https://alanmacdougall.com/forbidden-continent/aldea">Aldea</a>.)
    The power source is not understood, but instead of standard heavy
    cables, the power core is connected to the rest of the system by
    heavy copper ribbons stamped with brightly glowing magical runes.
    The runes themselves are connected, like a vertical cursive script,
    and power appears to flow through the runes, not through the copper
    itself.</p>
    <p>Simply pressing the rune into copper was not sufficient. By
    studying other arcanatech, modern arcanasmiths learned to create
    magical dies which could stamp the necessary runes and enable them
    to carry power or messages. Modern cables consist of a thin copper
    ribbon stamped with runes and covered in layers of canvas and silk.
    The user must take care to avoid breaking the ribbon when
    manipulating the cable.</p>
    <p>The ancients were able to make perfectly round cables, whose core
    was a round copper wire. Recent studies have shown that the copper
    wire is inscribed with runes so small they can be seen only with
    microscope. There are thousands of possible transmission paths
    through the microscopic runic matrix, so the wire is resilient
    against bending and breakage. Of course, creating such a wire is
    beyond human capabilities at the moment.</p>
