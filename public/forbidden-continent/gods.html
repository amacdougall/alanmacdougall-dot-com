    <h1 id="the-gods">The Gods</h1>
    <p>This is a world of gods. Some gods are concerned with the affairs
    of man, and rule over countries, directly or from afar. Some gods
    ignore mankind entirely, pursuing their own interests, obeying their
    own logic. Some gods are mighty, with the power to raise mountains
    and cause storms. Some gods are humble, with the power to reweave a
    ripped scarf or banish insects from a sack of grain. Some gods live
    in their own realm, seldom appearing in the mortal world. Some gods
    live in the flesh, side by side with their worshippers, sharing
    meals, dancing at festivals, and even working the fields.</p>
    <p>Gods can gain power over time, or lose it. Not all gods wish to
    be worshipped. The only trait shared by all gods is immortality, and
    even that immortality is limited: gods can be slain, if only by
    other gods and only by titanic efforts. And sometimes, gods have
    chosen to give up their immortality and die.</p>
    <h2 id="the-divine-pact">The Divine Pact</h2>
    <p>After the War of the Gods drove humanity away from the Forbidden
    Continent, the gods made a pact: human advancement would henceforth
    be a thing of humans. The gods could guide them in moral
    development, aid them with miracles, even govern them directly, but
    could never share the magical secrets which caused the downfall of
    mankind.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>The divine patron of Caledane. One of the most mighty gods, and
    widely worshipped throughout the world.</p>
    <p>Maravia represents war in all its forms: military conflict, of
    course, but more generally the act of competing against rivals for
    scarce resources, from international diplomacy to political
    discipline to the struggle for personal improvement. A concept this
    broad is easy to operationalize in the service of basically any
    human endeavor, and so the actions of the state of often seem to be
    at odds with a naive conception of "war."</p>
    <p>Depiction in religious art: a beautiful but stern woman with a
    brooding watchfulness. Sometimes represented as a mother, usually as
    a warrior. Her armor and weapons change with the era. In modern
    times, she is often depicted wearing a general's hat and leading a
    cavalry charge.</p>
    <p>Divine regalia: A halo whose rays of light are swords. Red and
    white cloth. Golden armor. A rose whose thorns draw blood. When she
    manifests, those small drops of blood are preserved as holy
    relics.</p>
    <p>Holy symbols: A red teardrop, symbolizing blood. A golden sword,
    or a golden shield; or, lately, a golden firearm. Her priesthood can
    be recognized by a certain pattern of white with thin red stripes;
    it's as distinctive as a Catholic priest's collar.</p>
    <h4 id="manifestation">Manifestation</h4>
    <p>Once a year, at least until 1795, she would manifest at the grand
    cathedral in Blueport, showing favor to the humble request of the
    king. The finest of Caledane's nobles are present; and so are its
    most prized prisoners of war.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Maravia floats above the altar, motionless, silent, and every
    living thing, man or beast, worshipper or foe, is made to kneel by
    the very power of her presence. A thin thread of blood fills the
    blood-runnel of her sword, and where the drops touch the ground,
    they become rubies. For fifteen long minutes, all in attendance are
    utterly motionless, gaze transfixed by the goddess, thoughts utterly
    focused upon her. It is no longer necessary to breathe. The heart no
    longer needs to beat. There is a silence deeper than the depth of
    the sea. The only sound is the slow, irregular click of blood-rubies
    striking the floor and rolling away.</p>
    <p>And then she is gone, and the spell is broken, and everyone
    remembers to breathe all at once.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Since 1795, when King Henry fled to New Caledane to rule in
    exile, neither King Henry nor the bickering noblemen of the
    Protectorate have requested the blessing of Maravia, claiming that
    Caledane must be reunited before its goddess may be honorably
    invoked. This may be true; but if the goddess were summoned, and
    declined to appear, it would be an existential threat to the
    legitimacy of the supposed ruler. Neither Henry nor the Protectorate
    are willing to run that risk.</p>
    <h3 id="antonius-god-of-love">Antonius, God of Love</h3>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/gods/antonius_god_of_love.png"
    alt="His ethereal beauty hypnotizes women and men alike, and his holy word proclaims the genderless universality of Love, for love is the expression of all human desires." />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>His ethereal beauty hypnotizes
    women and men alike, and his holy word proclaims the genderless
    universality of Love, for love is the expression of all human
    desires.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Antonius represents love in all its forms: romantic love, of
    course, but also the love of a parent for a child, or a citizen for
    their country. A concept this broad is easy to operationalize in the
    service of basically any human endeavor, and so the actions of the
    state often seem to be at odds with a naive conception of
    "love."</p>
    <p>Antonius claims to encompass both male and female, because love
    is universal. But when a particularly bold priest once asked whether
    Antonius should be referred to as male or female, the god breezily
    replied, "My dear Maravia is my opposite, is she not? War and love,
    red and blue, fire and sea. She is hot-blooded and I am as cool as a
    cucumber. She is a goddess&mdash;so why not call me a god?"</p>
    <p>Depiction in religious art: a beautiful young person with flowing
    black hair. Artists consider it a point of pride to come as close as
    possible to a perfectly androgynous appearance.</p>
    <p>Usually represented playing music or at the center of a
    celebration; sometimes shown as a wise counselor to a king. In
    modern times, he is often depicted with recent inventions or
    discoveries.</p>
    <p>Divine regalia: A silver implement adorned with a blue sapphire.
    Traditionally a scepter, but recently more modern implements have
    been observed: a pocketwatch, a conductor's wand, a fountain pen,
    even an umbrella. His priesthood is known for grand robes during
    services, and upper-class finery the rest of the time.</p>
    <p>Holy symbols: The religion equates love with the vast and eternal
    sky, so a white circle on a blue field, or a blue circle on a white
    field, are both taken as symbols of Antonius. Likewise, any blue gem
    or stone, such as sapphire or lapis lazuli, usually in a silver
    setting.</p>
    <p>Quite contrary to Maravia's dramatic annual manifestation,
    Antonius can be found wherever there is joy in the hearts of man. A
    masked ball held by the finest of nobles, or a peasant dance around
    a fire to the tune of a single fiddle, are equally likely to draw
    his attention. He dresses for the occasion, in blue and white finery
    or in blue and gray rags, and always brings a tray of delicacies, a
    barrel of wine or beer, and spends hours entertaining the company
    with songs, jokes, and dances. He requires tribute, of course; as
    the god of love, he always steals away into the night as the party
    winds down, taking one or two of the youngest and most beautiful
    revelers with him.</p>
    <p>Sometimes they even come home again.</p>
    <h3 id="hod-epi-and-ametta-the-home-gods">Hod, Epi, and Ametta, the
    Home Gods</h3>
    <p>Hod, of the Hearth. Epi, of the Yard. Ametta, of the Foundation.
    Every home on earth, from Broadland to Centramundi to Aldea, has a
    shrine to these three gods. They ask little. For Hod, lay a grain of
    barley on a tiny plate once a day. For Epi, place a few drops of
    milk in a tiny dish once a week. For Ametta, place a coin on a tiny
    altar once a month&mdash;never mind the value.</p>
    <p>Say a prayer. The offering disappears in a slow and steady little
    flame: red for Hod, gold for Epi, blue for Ametta. And for another
    day, or week, or month, your home is as safe as these gods can make
    it.</p>
    <p>Of course, the Gods of Storms might blow your roof away, or the
    Gods of Plagues might kill your children, or the Goddess of War
    might visit her thousands of potential woes upon your home. For
    those gods are great, and the Home Gods are small.</p>
    <h3 id="anaxarchus-god-of-storms">Anaxarchus, God of Storms</h3>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/gods/anaxarchus_god_of_storms.webp"
    alt="Anaxarchus means you no harm; but he means you no good. Seek cover." />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>Anaxarchus means you no harm; but
    he means you no good. Seek cover.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>A vast face seen in a stormbank. The shape of a fist, burned into
    the ground after a lightning strike. A wistful sigh that comes from
    the heart of a rainbow after a squall. Anaxarchus has a priesthood,
    but grants them no miracles. Sailors pray to him, but he never
    answers.</p>
    <h3 id="tara-goddess-of-learning">Tara, Goddess of Learning</h3>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/gods/tara_goddess_of_learning.png"
    alt="Always learning, always teaching." />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>Always learning, always
    teaching.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The ruler of the Infinite Library, currently in northwest
    Venetonne. In its endless halls and galleries, her library holds a
    copy of every book that will ever be written, but those who go in
    search of secrets seldom find their way back out. Wiser to learn at
    Tara's feet. She shared only the knowledge of the day, for the
    Divine Pact requires that mankind work hard for its own advancement.
    But the goddess is always present, in the flesh, ever wakeful,
    endlessly reading, writing, or teaching.</p>
    <h3 id="aht-god-of-stones">Aht, God of Stones</h3>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/gods/aht_god_of_stones.webp"
    alt="As slow as mountains, and as sure." />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>As slow as mountains, and as
    sure.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>His limbs limbs are pillars, his body is a dolmen, his head is
    rough-hewn of granite. His beard itself is stone. He trudges slowly
    along the valleys between the Fallen Star Mountains in the southern
    Midlands, bearing on his back a boulder the size of a skiff. His
    footfalls make the earth tremble. Every year, on the night of the
    spring equinox, he sets down his burden, as gently as a mother
    laying her child to rest, and picks up another.</p>
    <h3 id="the-god-of-confusion">The God of Confusion</h3>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/gods/god_of_confusion.webp"
    alt="When you meet him, shake his hand." />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>When you meet him, shake his
    hand.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The God of Confusion lives in the town which bears his name: God
    of Confusion, Brook County, Amarenne. A casual visitor to God of
    Confusion, or "goddaconfuzh'n" as the locals call it, might find it
    a totally ordinary town, with a general store, a few small
    businesses, some houses, and miles of farmland in every direction.
    Stick around a spell, and this visitor might meet the god himself,
    and have a pleasant chat with him. Maybe the god will sing a song
    around the bonfire, when his turn comes up. But those who actively
    seek the God of Confusion will find themselves at the nearest road
    out of town, wondering how they got there. The God of Confusion has
    no name; at least, no name anyone can remember.</p>
    <h3 id="slippery-mick-god-of-locks">Slippery Mick, God of Locks</h3>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/gods/slippery_mick_god_of_locks.webp"
    alt="A welcome sight when you&#39;re in a tight spot." />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>A welcome sight when you're in a
    tight spot.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>A patron of thieves and spies, Slippery Mick is in the business
    of opening locks, not closing them. A thief in a desperate spot
    might pray to Slippery Mick, making him a bargain: deliver me from
    this pass, and I will give you a thousand in gold. If the thief
    escapes, and the offering is made, the gold will turn to lead as
    Slippery Mick spirits away its value. If the thief escapes, and the
    offering is forsworn, the thief's next imprisonment is sure to be
    his last.</p>
    <h3 id="ammon-god-of-order">Ammon, God of Order</h3>
    <p>Divine patron of Centramundi. Ammon makes no claim to represent
    or embody order. Ammon simply enforces order. The rest of the world
    may do what it likes, but if Centramundi is to persist for eternity,
    it must have stability. Often associated with scholarship,
    discipline, and loyalty.</p>
    <p>Depiction in religious art: Uniquely among the gods, Ammon is
    never depicted as any living creature. Instead, Ammon appears as a
    white rectangle or a rectangular prism which casts a piercing
    illumination on its surroundings. Religious texts studiously avoid
    using any gendered language to describe Ammon.</p>
    <p>Holy symbols: Miniature examples of anything related to geometry
    or mathemtics. Protractor, calipers, compass, abacus, slide rule.
    Geometric shapes have picked up complex symbolism over the
    millennia, so people might wear a small gold circle, or triangle, in
    order to convey a host of cultural and political allegiances.
    Through the will of Ammon, these allegiances have never risen to the
    level of factionalism, but they are powerful forces in Centramundian
    society.</p>
    <h3 id="amina-goddess-of-rings">Amina, Goddess of Rings</h3>
    <p>Divine patron to jewelers, harness-makers, wheelwrights, coopers,
    and anyone else with a keen interest in the creation of perfectly
    circular objects, including some geometers and cartographers. She
    has assisted Exmundi in finding independence from Centramundi, but
    declines to be considered their patron.</p>
    <p>Depiction in religious art: A girl of no more than six, dressed
    in the everyday clothing of her local worshippers, floating in the
    air, framed by a large gold ring. She wears rings on each finger and
    toe, and great bunches of bracelets; and over her clothing there is
    always a harness whose straps are joined by rings. When depicted in
    armor, of course, it is always ring mail.</p>
    <p>Holy symbols: A simple gold ring, unadorned; but she is a minor
    goddess, and this is a common form of decoration.</p>
