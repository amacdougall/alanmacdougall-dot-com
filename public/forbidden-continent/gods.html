    <h1 id="the-gods">The Gods</h1>
    <p>This is a world of gods. Some gods are concerned with the affairs
    of man, and rule over countries, directly or from afar. Some gods
    ignore mankind entirely, pursuing their own interests, obeying their
    own logic. Some gods are mighty, with the power to raise mountains
    and cause storms. Some gods are humble, with the power to reweave a
    ripped scarf or banish insects from a sack of grain. Some gods live
    in their own realm, seldom appearing in the mortal world. Some gods
    live in the flesh, side by side with their worshippers, sharing
    meals, dancing at festivals, and even working the fields.</p>
    <p>Gods can gain power over time, or lose it. Not all gods wish to
    be worshipped. The only trait shared by all gods is immortality, and
    even that immortality is limited: gods can be slain, if only by
    other gods and only by titanic efforts. And sometimes, gods have
    chosen to give up their immortality and die.</p>
    <h2 id="the-divine-pact">The Divine Pact</h2>
    <p>After the War of the Gods drove humanity away from the Forbidden
    Continent, the gods made a pact: human advancement would henceforth
    be a thing of humans. The gods could guide them in moral
    development, aid them with miracles, even govern them directly, but
    could never share the magical secrets which caused the downfall of
    mankind.</p>
    <h2 id="a-sampling-of-gods">A Sampling of Gods</h2>
    <p>Feel free to make up more.</p>
    <h3 id="anaxarchus-god-of-storms">Anaxarchus, God of Storms</h3>
    <p>A vast face seen in a stormbank. The shape of a fist, burned into
    the ground after a lightning strike. A wistful sigh that comes from
    the heart of a rainbow after a squall. Anaxarchus has a priesthood,
    but grants them no miracles. Sailors pray to him, but he never
    answers.</p>
    <h3 id="tara-goddess-of-learning">Tara, Goddess of Learning</h3>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/gods/tara_goddess_of_learning.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>The ruler of the Infinite Library, currently in northwest
    Venetonne. In its endless halls and galleries, her library holds a
    copy of every book that will ever be written, but those who go in
    search of secrets seldom find their way back out. Wiser to learn at
    Tara's feet. She shared only the knowledge of the day, for the
    Divine Pact requires that mankind work hard for its own advancement.
    But the goddess is always present, in the flesh, ever wakeful,
    endlessly reading, writing, or teaching.</p>
    <h3 id="aht-god-of-stones">Aht, God of Stones</h3>
    <p>His limbs limbs are pillars, his body is a dolmen, his head is a
    rough-hewn cube of granite. He has no face, only weathered stone. He
    trudges slowly along the valleys between the Fallen Star Mountains
    in the southern Midlands, bearing on his back a boulder the size of
    a skiff. His footfalls make the earth tremble. Every year, on the
    night of the spring equinox, he sets down his burden, as gently as a
    mother laying her child to rest, and picks up another.</p>
    <h3 id="the-god-of-confusion">The God of Confusion</h3>
    <p>The God of Confusion lives in the town which bears his name: God
    of Confusion, Brook County, Amarenne. A casual visitor to God of
    Confusion, or "goddaconfuzh'n" as the locals call it, might find it
    a totally ordinary town, with a general store, a few small
    businesses, some houses, and miles of farmland in every direction.
    Stick around a spell, and this visitor might meet the god himself,
    and have a pleasant chat with him. Maybe the god will sing a song
    around the bonfire, when his turn comes up. But those who actively
    seek the God of Confusion will find themselves at the nearest road
    out of town, wondering how they got there. The God of Confusion has
    no name; at least, no name anyone can remember.</p>
    <h3 id="slippery-mick-god-of-locks">Slippery Mick, God of Locks</h3>
    <p>A patron of thieves and spies, Slippery Mick is in the business
    of opening locks, not closing them. A thief in a desperate spot
    might pray to Slippery Mick, making him a bargain: deliver me from
    this pass, and I will give you a thousand in gold. If the thief
    escapes, and the offering is made, the gold will turn to lead as
    Slippery Mick spirits away its value. If the thief escapes, and the
    offering is forsworn, the thief's next imprisonment is sure to be
    his last.</p>
    <h3 id="maravia-goddess-of-war">Maravia, Goddess of War</h3>
    <p>Discussed further in the section on Caledane. One of the most
    mighty goddesses, and widely worshipped throughout the world. Once a
    year, she manifests at the grand cathedral in Blueport, showing
    favor to the humble request of the king. The finest of Caledane's
    nobles are present; and so are its most prized prisoners of war.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Maravia floats above the altar, motionless, silent, and every
    living thing, man or beast, worshipper or foe, is made to kneel by
    the very power of her presence. A thin thread of blood fills the
    blood-runnel of her sword, and where the drops touch the ground,
    they become rubies. For fifteen long minutes, all in attendance are
    utterly motionless, gaze transfixed by the goddess, thoughts utterly
    focused upon her. It is no longer necessary to breathe. The heart no
    longer needs to beat. There is a silence deeper than the depth of
    the sea. The only sound is the slow, irregular click of blood-rubies
    striking the floor and rolling away.</p>
    <p>And then she is gone, and the spell is broken, and everyone
    remembers to breathe all at once.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="antonius-god-of-love">Antonius, God of Love</h3>
    <p>Discussed further in the section on Venetonne. Quite contrary to
    Maravia's dramatic annual manifestation, Antonius can be found
    wherever there is joy in the hearts of man. A masked ball held by
    the finest of nobles, or a peasant dance around a fire to the tune
    of a single fiddle, are equally likely to draw his attention. He
    dresses for the occasion, in blue and white finery or in blue and
    gray rags, and always brings a tray of delicacies, a barrel of wine
    or beer, and spends hours entertaining the company with songs,
    jokes, and dances. He requires tribute, of course; as the god of
    love, he always steals away into the night as the party winds down,
    taking one, or two, or three, or a crowd, of the youngest and most
    beautiful revelers with him.</p>
    <p>Sometimes they even come home again.</p>
