    <p>Casting a spell is difficult. Learning a spell is harder.</p>
    <aside>
    <p>Here is everything that normal people know about magic.</p>
    <p>Some people can cast spells. The talent runs in families. You can
    learn spells from a teacher if you're rich and talented, or you can
    find spellbooks in the ruins if you're brave and lucky.</p>
    <p>If you write a spell down, it looks like a complicated diagram of
    little symbols connected by squiggly lines. Smart people like to
    have framed diagrams on their walls to show how educated they
    are.</p>
    <p>Spells are dangerous. Some spells give you horrible deformities
    if you get them wrong. Some give you horrible deformities even if
    you get them right. Don't mess with magic.</p>
    <p>Most spells are useful for everyday tasks. Combat spells are
    rare. But the big nations are starting to add "mage knights" to
    their armies.</p>

    <h3 id="casting-spells">Casting Spells</h3>
    <p>A spell consists of three components: a <em>diagram</em> made of
    <em>glyphs</em>, connected by <em>impulses</em>.</p>
    <p>A <em>glyph</em> is a symbol, but like a Tarot card, it is more
    than just an image. Every glyph has a visual aspect, a symbol which
    can be written down or a shape which can be sculpted; but is also
    has an <em>essence</em>, a sort of metaphysical flavor.</p>
    <p>An <em>impulse</em> is an energy which passes from one glyph to
    another. A transformation, or an argument, or a refutation. An
    impulse is "performed" by speaking a word, or making a gesture, or
    sometimes simply by thinking about it; but every impulse also has an
    essence which must be understood.</p>
    <p>To cast a spell, these essences must be "called to mind," much as
    you might reconstruct a scene from memory. Scholars call this <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification">reification</a>.
    Complex diagrams or powerful essences make reification more
    difficult. See "Learning Spells" below.</p>
    <p>A <em>diagram</em> is a collection of symbols connected by
    <em>impulses</em>. A spellcaster must envision the diagram, with all
    its glyphs and essences, and then perform the impulses acting in the
    sequence described by the connecting lines.</p>
    <figure>

    alt="A diagram spotted in Massachusetts, which inspired this vision of spellcasting." />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>A diagram spotted in
    Massachusetts, which inspired this vision of
    spellcasting.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Essences cannot be adequately described in human language. A
    spell cannot be "taught" to a complete beginner. Someone who already
    knows some glyphs and impulses can learn a different spell which
    uses the same components, however. Related spells often do use the
    same components, and are considered "schools" of magic.</p>
    <p>A practiced spellcaster can use a spell at will, and with no more
    thought than the impulse to do it. Think of it as opening your front
    door: you reach in your pocket, take out a key, put it in the lock,
    turn the key, and so on, but at no point do you have to concentrate
    on how exactly to kick off the operation, or what you should do at
    each step along the way.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if someone is trying to fistfight you, or if
    you're in the middle of a tornado, or if you're under time pressure,
    you might have a hard time managing the procedure. Spellcasting is
    no different.</p>
    <p>In game terms, quick spells are easier to cast under pressure.
    Complex spells are harder, and might take more than one action. A
    spell with verbal components cannot be cast while mute; a spell with
    somatic components requires one or both hands free. As you can
    imagine, one-handed spells are prized.</p>

    <h3 id="learning-spells">Learning Spells</h3>
    <p>Essences can only be learned by direct transmission into the
    brain. You might listen to a piece of music from an ancient machine.
    Look deep into a shifting color pattern in a viewing glass. Sleep
    for a night at the top of a chrome tower which was built on the
    floor of a great canyon, and wake during a nightmare. The essence is
    painted on the inside of your skull. You can recall it at will.</p>
    <p>All essences have limiting properties called <em>resonance</em>,
    <em>intensity</em>, and <em>depth</em>.</p>
    <aside>
    In game terms: <em>Resonance</em> consumes maximum spell size.
    <em>Depth</em> increases the time or cost to learn.
    <em>Intensity</em> is an experience requirement. I don't have
    numeric rules for this yet, and it might not be necessary.
    </aside>
    <ul>
    <li>A <em>resonant</em> essence is difficult to reify during
    spellcasting. It drowns out other essences, like an instrument
    played too loud in an orchestra.</li>
    <li>An <em>intense</em> essence is something unfamiliar to the human
    mind, an alien thought pattern which can only be reified by a
    practiced spellcaster.</li>
    <li>A <em>deep</em> essence is complicated and nuanced, requiring
    long study or special efforts to fully apprehend.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A single artifact which teaches a full spell, diagram, essences,
    and all, is called a "grimoire."</p>
    <figure>

    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>Idealized portrait of Kimberly
    Blackheart, the first sorceress. Reckless experimentation led to her
    death within months. Her grimoire was destroyed along with
    her.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Diagrams do not have essences, but glyphs and impulses do.
    Sometimes a trove of grimoires is found in some ancient hall of
    learning. Sometimes an essence is found resting on a pedestal in an
    ancient tomb, or clutched in a skeletal hand in a mass grave. The
    diagram for the spell which sank the <em>HMS Logos</em> was found as
    a decoration on a shirt in an ancient clothing store. One legendary
    grimoire was found embedded in the ribcage of an unfortunate
    spellcaster who was encased in cement in a metal barrel and left at
    the bottom of a lake.</p>
    <p>Some people have chosen to dedicate their lives to the
    acquisition of spells, for one reason or another. It's not
    impossible to build up quite a suite of spells, by taking on debt,
    or having a wealthy patron, or dedicated scavenging in the ruins.
    Pretentious names like "sorceror" or "wizard" draw a polite chuckle
    if they are not well-earned.</p>
    <h3 id="dangers-of-magic">Dangers of Magic</h3>
    <p>Some inflict horrible deformities, diseases, or insanity. Anyone
    casting an untrusted spell risks his life. Whether the spells are
    defective or simply misused is a topic of debate. Reckless
    magic-seekers are distrusted. Fear of witches used to be
    superstition. Those who have claimed the name in recent years are
    well worthy of their reputation.</p>
    <h2 id="schools-of-magic">Schools of Magic</h2>
    <p>A "school" of magic is a collection of spells which share common
    glyphs and impulses, but different diagrams. Some schools of magic
    are carefully guarded by guilds; others are freely accessible to
    those with money or connections. Guilds limit their most powerful
    essences to the higher ranks.</p>
    <h3 id="the-school-of-hod">The School of Hod</h3>
    <p>A school of magic associated with Hod, god of the Hearth. After
    the rediscovery of magic, Hod began to reveal these essences and
    diagrams, bit by bit, to those who made their daily sacrifice. These
    are tiny essences, and tiny spells, which ease the burdens of
    everyday life, just a little. In every town and village, there are a
    few who have shown an aptitude for this magic.</p>
    <p>Typical spells:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>Turn the Earth:</em> Temporarily sharpen the point of a
    plowshare.</li>
    <li><em>The Merry Reaper:</em> Cast upon a scythe, it causes the
    fallen stalks to align as if by magnetism for easier gathering.</li>
    <li><em>Raise Bread:</em> Cast upon a newly turned loaf, causes it
    to rise within minutes instead of hours. Changes of the flavor, but
    not unpleasantly so.</li>
    <li><em>Mend:</em> Restores a broken pot or glass, if cast within a
    few seconds of the break. More complex items are beyond its
    reach.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="the-spellbreakers">The Spellbreakers</h3>
    <p>TODO: A guild dedicated to countermagic, a rare and
    little-understood branch of magic. Strong military wing.</p>
    <p>Note that they do not have a monopoly on antimagic, but they do
    guard a particularly good set of antimagic essences.</p>
    <h3 id="the-brotherhood-of-light">The Brotherhood of Light</h3>
    <p>TODO: A guild with light magic of some sort.</p>
    <h3 id="the-truthseekers">The Truthseekers</h3>
    <p>TODO: A guild with antidivination and obfuscation magic,
    dedicated to the suppression of knowledge.</p>
    <h3 id="arcanists">Arcanists</h3>
    <p>TODO: Spells related to arcanatech. This school of magic is used
    to create interfaces, control arcanatech and automata, and perform
    research.</p>
    <p>The Clockwork Club of Blueport originated as a group of noblemen
    and scholars with an interest in the use of clockworks for complex
    automation, and after the rediscovery of magic, it has become a
    <em>de facto</em> guild of arcanists.</p>
