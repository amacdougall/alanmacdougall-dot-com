    return from the Little War. This dramatic painting is still quite a

    <p>The King of New Caledane, born 1776. He was crowned as an infant,
    after the passing of his father King Godfrey, and was called "the
    Boy-King". Now 24, he has retained the nickname; it is usually used
    fondly.</p>
    <aside>
    <p>"Victory", in the Little War, was actually a negotiated
    settlement in which Caledane achieved two of its four war aims, for
    a strictly marginal increase in the prosperity of New Caledane, but
    <em>culturally</em> it was a triumph.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>His first act as king was to sail to Aldea to personally take
    command of the Little War, which had begun in 1791 with a series of
    stinging defeats. In 1792, at the age of sixteen, King Henry led his
    army to a hard-fought victory, the turning point on the path to
    victory. In the dusk of the day of the battle, he famously walked
    the camp and shook the hand of each man who had stood with him&mdash;an
    unprecedented gesture that cemented his reputation as the king of
    the people.</p>
    <p>In 1795, the Friends of Society rebelled, and secured control of
    Caledane, establishing themselves as the Protectorate. King Henry
    was forced to flee across the ocean, along with a small group of
    supporters, and was welcomed with open arms in New Caledane. He now
    rules New Caledane as a reformer who is steadily giving away his
    power and his hereditary privileges.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
    If the Unbroken Thread has been cut, so be it. Let that loose thread
    become part of a greater cloth, one woven from all good folk of
    Caledane, and may it cover all of Aldea in glory.

    <h3 id="duke-marcus-of-falchester">Duke Marcus of Falchester</h3>
    <p><img src="images/characters/marcus_of_falchester.jpg" /></p>
    <p>Duke of the region which includes Blueport. Leader of the Friends
    of Society. Implicitly unfavorable to the workers, though a worker
    class consciousness does not yet exist as a political issue.</p>
    <p>Assassinated during the massacre of Barleyvale.</p>

    <figure>
    <img src="images/characters/andrew_of_brownswell.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>An owner of the Barleyvale Works, actually one of a consortium of
    shareholders. Visits the works a few times a year to review the
    books along with a team of accountants. Wears a tailcoat and a top
    hat, and a pocket watch with a chain, showing his alliance with the
    Friends of Society.</p>
    <p>Narrowly escaped death during the explosion of violence after the
    Barleyvale Massacre. Occupies a position of power in the
    Protectorate, but is continually embattled, as the Friends of
    Society jockey for position in the new order.</p>

    <p>An influential member of the Companions of the King in Blueport.
    An old friend of the king's advisor Duke Lloyd.</p>
    <p>Holds a <em>salon</em>, as they like to say in Venetonne, where
    conservative intellectuals and nobles shudder in horror at the
    effects of so-called Progress upon the mythic fields of Caledane.
    She considers the civil war and the exile of the king "a blood
    sacrifice upon the altar of progress, and may the Golden Blade stand
    ready against the demons which might now be loosed!" As the leader
    of the minority faction in Parliament, she does what she can to
    mitigate the reign of the Protectorate.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>A hero of the Little War. Served directly under the king, even
    exchanged words with him once. Came home seven years ago with a
    medal made of real gold, and never sold it even in the bad years. A
    steady hand at the Works for years now. Recently finished his
    arcanasmith apprenticeship.</p>
    <p>A clean-cut man in his twenties, with a ready smile.</p>

    <h3 id="emmett-woodlawn-molder-apprentice">Emmett Woodlawn, Molder
    Apprentice</h3>
    <p><img src="images/characters/emmett_woodlawn.webp" /></p>
    <p>The agitator. He went to school in Montaigne, or at least went to
    Montaigne and got drunk with students, and when his money ran out,
    he came back with a head full of ideas about collective action and
    the power of the poor over the rich. By day, he helps make the molds
    into which the iron is poured for bespoke work. By night, he is a
    regular presence at the Velvet Room, eager to discuss the politics
    of the day, especially the changing economic landscape and the
    wonders coming from New Caledane.</p>
    <p>A thin but muscular man with a shock of messy black hair. Doesn't
    look like an intellectual until you hear him talk. Has a flair for
    poetic turns of phrase.</p>
    <p>Killed in the Barleyvale Massacre.</p>

    <h3 id="jaques-old-turtle-fletcher-molder">Jaques "Old Turtle"
    Fletcher, Molder</h3>
    <p><img src="images/characters/old_turtle.jpeg" /></p>
    <p>Old-timer, musician, stabilizing influence. He argues back and
    forth with his apprentice Emmett about how fast things should
    change. Old ways are best sometimes; things are there for a reason.
    He would rather just play his music and make people laugh, or maybe
    shed a little tear.</p>
    <p>A balding man in late middle age, but strong and vital. He and
    Emmett work big, and even with a block and tackle, moving those clay
    molds is not a job for weaklings.</p>

    <h3 id="kevin-rockledge-floor-manager">Kevin Rockledge, Floor
    Manager</h3>
    <p><img src="images/characters/kevin_rockledge.jpeg" /></p>
    <p>Likes to throw his weight around, a classic management bully.
    Always looking for an infraction so he can issue a report or a
    warning. At night, sometimes he patrols the outside of the
    shield-fence to scare away any vagrants or drunks who are sleeping
    too close to the factory. He's been seen shoving them into the fence
    to watch it knock them flat.</p>
    <p>He especially keeps his eye on Brandon Sanclement, and has even
    followed him around the neighborhood at times. Like all management,
    Rockledge is not welcome at the Velvet Room. The one time he tried
    to show up and blend in, everyone left without a word, and Mrs.
    Broadleaf closed up shop without serving him.</p>

    <h3 id="richard-st.-angus-general-manager">Richard St. Angus,
    General Manager</h3>
    <p><img src="images/characters/richard_st_angus.jpeg" /></p>
    <p>The highest-ranking person who is present at the Works every day.
    The only one who has contact with the Owners. The workers see him as
    a outsider imposed upon them by inscrutable laws of nature; the
    Owners see him as a jumped-up tradesman.</p>

    <h3 id="captain-lionel-blackhill">Captain Lionel Blackhill</h3>
    <p><img src="images/characters/captain_lionel_blackhill.jpeg" /></p>
    <p>Army officer in command of the detail which stormed the Works.
    Veteran of the Little War, commanded the Barleyvale unit where
    Morton Quayside and John Nickelbrook served.</p>
    <p>Now called the Butcher of Barleyvale for his role in the
    massacre. Even those who support the Friends of Society and their
    Protectorate generally condemn the massacre.</p>
