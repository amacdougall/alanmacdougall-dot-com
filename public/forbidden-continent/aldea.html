    <h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
    <p>The eastern coast of the continent was the first to be colonized
    by the great powers. Caledane and Venetonne control the northeast;
    Centramundi controls the southeast. The colonies extend inland, but
    as you travel further west, central authority grows weaker.</p>
    <p>For instance, along the coast, the colonial cities of Caledane
    and Venetonne are ruled by governors&mdash;noblemen, to be sure, but
    accountable to the crown. Further inland, provinces are ruled by
    noblemen who exercise a more personal form of power. And beyond
    those lands, noble estates grow more rare, and the wilderness more
    dangerous, and before long, power is to be found only at the end of
    a gun-barrel. Settlers, trappers, prospectors, and treasure hunters,
    all exist in an uneasy truce which lasts only as long as there is
    plenty for all.</p>
    <p>The same pattern applies to the more southerly holdings of
    Centramundi, but for different reasons. "Heaven is wide, and the
    emperor is far away," says a common proverb. A minister of the state
    must obey the imperial edict: each sealed scroll represents the very
    will of Ammon. But these orders are broadly strategic, and the
    ministers are left to decide upon the details, with varying results;
    and of course, the difficulty of travel and communication makes it
    impossible to project the full weight of imperial authority out to
    the very frontier.</p>
    <h2 id="new-caledane">New Caledane</h2>
    <p>Caledane's territory in Aldea is inventively called "New
    Caledane", though of course it has many counties. New Caledane does
    not have states or provinces, because it was decreed a crown colony
    by will of the king. Instead, Caledane has appointed governors who
    serve at his majesty's pleasure. Many of these governors are
    noblemen in their own right, however, or wish to be, and the further
    they are from the coast, the more they seek to extract value for
    themselves.</p>

    Caledane</h3>
    <h2 id="amarenne">Amarenne</h2>
    <p>Venetonne's territory in Aldea is called Amarenne, after the
    crown princess at the time, now Queen Amara IV. In the early days of
    colonization, Venetonnian nobles sent expeditions at their own
    expense, and have established city-states or provinces which chafe
    at the external control of the queen.</p>
    <h3 id="todo-a-few-cities-of-amarenne">TODO: a few cities of
    Amarenne</h3>
    <h2 id="the-newlands">The Newlands</h2>
    <p>Centramundi laid claim to a coastal region along the southern
    shore of Aldea, and expanded from there. Since Aldea is to the north
    of Centramundi, the coast is called "The Northern Frontier".</p>
    <p>The official name of Centramundi's Aldean holdings is "the New
    Lands." As proper worshippers of Ammon, the Centramundian
    bureaucracy is not well known for its creativity; perhaps they
    should have let a Scroll Knight name it. Centramundians meticulously
    pronounce all three words, but Broadlanders call it "the
    Newlands."</p>
    <h3 id="north-town">North Town</h3>
    <p>The founding city of the Newlands is called the Northern Capital.
    Broadlanders call it "North Town," often shortened to "Nawthton".
    North Town is a city of majestic buildings of stone and elegantly
    carved wood, reminiscent of the City of Heaven, Centramundi's
    capital. Designed from the very beginning to serve as the
    administrative center of a major new province, North Town feels huge
    and empty, and many districts are no more than carefully surveyed
    plots of perfectly leveled dirt.</p>
    <p>The center of North Town, near the port, is lively, bustling, and
    dense, teeming with people from all over the world. Before the
    reopening of Aldea, travel from Broadland to Centramundi was
    extremely difficult. Now, although the journey still takes nearly
    half a year, it is safe and reliable, and North Town is a major
    waypoint.</p>
    <p>[Loosely based on New Orleans, of course, but with Chinese
    influences instead of French.]</p>
    <h2 id="exmundi">Exmundi</h2>
    <p>Centramundi built their Aldean colonies on the backs of the
    Lowlands tribes, a regional rival they had subjugated centuries ago.
    The Lowlanders in Centramundi were already oppressed, impoverished,
    and rightfully resentful; in Aldea, they were exploited even
    further. The outer reaches of the Newlands were settled by
    Lowlanders, but they were treated as serfs, legally prohibited from
    leaving their assigned farmlands or logging camps.</p>
    <p>They rebelled, successfully, and formed the independent nation of
    Exmundi, which has its heart in a broad valley in the Midlands.
    Caledane and Venetonne have found it to be in their interest to
    support Exmundi, and so the balance of power remains on a knife
    edge.</p>
    <p>In Centramundi, the Lowlanders had long since been forced from
    the most fertile land and forced to subsist on the steppes as horse
    nomads. Not a lifestyle anyone would choose, but they developed a
    culture where every able-bodied soul had to be a herder, ranger, and
    warrior. Think of the various steppe nomads of northern Asia,
    notably the Mongols. On Centramundi, they were kept in check by the
    empire and its god, but on Aldea, they found themselves in a more
    favorable position&mdash;and were shielded from Ammon's attention by the
    protective hand of Amina, the Goddess of Rings.</p>
    <p>As nomads with little love for cities, the Lowlanders of Exmundi
    have chosen to reclaim the traditional way of life which was long
    suppressed by Centramundi. Their new lands are more fruitful than
    their historic ones, so many Lowlanders have become farmers or
    town-dwellers, but Exmundi has also parlayed their legendary riding
    and skirmishing talents into <em>de facto</em> control of most of
    the trade routes through the Midlands. By taking a percentage of all
    trade that passes through their extensive territory, and modifying
    that percentage to favor one interest or another, they have achieved
    economic and political power.</p>
    <p>The Abacus Knights are the enforcement wing of Exmundi's trade
    regulations. While the Scroll Knights of Centramundi are
    warrior-poets, Exmundi's Abacus Knights mockingly call themselves
    warrior-accountants, whose duty is to make sure Exmundi extracts its
    fair share.</p>
    <p>Exmundi is in a good position as of 1800, but not a stable one.
    The Newlands, New Caledane, and Amarenne are all expanding further
    into the Midlands, and their existing holdings will only grow in
    population. In time, Exmundi will face a territorial reckoning.</p>
    <h3 id="amina-goddess-of-rings">Amina, Goddess of Rings</h3>
    <p>Divine patron to jewelers, harness-makers, wheelwrights, coopers,
    and anyone else with a keen interest in the creation of perfectly
    circular objects, including some geometers and cartographers. She
    has assisted Exmundi in finding independence from Centramundi, but
    declines to be considered their patron.</p>
    <p>Depiction in religious art: A girl of no more than six, dressed
    in the everyday clothing of her local worshippers, floating in the
    air, framed by a large gold ring. She wears rings on each finger and
    toe, and great bunches of bracelets; and over her clothing there is
    always a harness whose straps are joined by rings. When depicted in
    armor, of course, it is always ring mail.</p>
    <p>Holy symbols: A simple gold ring, unadorned; but she is a minor
    goddess, and this is a common form of decoration.</p>
