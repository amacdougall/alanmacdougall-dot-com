    <h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
    <p>The eastern coast of the continent was the first to be colonized
    by the great powers. Caledane and Venetonne control the northeast;
    Centramundi controls the southeast. The colonies extend inland, but
    as you travel further west, central authority grows weaker.</p>
    <p>For instance, along the coast, the colonial cities of Caledane
    and Venetonne are ruled by governors&mdash;noblemen, to be sure, but
    accountable to the crown. Further inland, provinces are ruled by
    noblemen who exercise a more personal form of power. And beyond
    those lands, noble estates grow more rare, and the wilderness more
    dangerous, and before long, power is to be found only at the end of
    a gun-barrel. Settlers, trappers, prospectors, and treasure hunters,
    all exist in an uneasy truce which lasts only as long as there is
    plenty for all.</p>
    <p>The same pattern applies to the more southerly holdings of
    Centramundi, but for different reasons. "Heaven is wide, and the
    emperor is far away," says a common proverb. A minister of the state
    must obey the imperial edict: each sealed scroll represents the very
    will of Ammon. But these orders are broadly strategic, and the
    ministers are left to decide upon the details, with varying results;
    and of course, the difficulty of travel and communication makes it
    impossible to project the full weight of imperial authority out to
    the very frontier.</p>
    <h2 id="new-caledane">New Caledane</h2>

    <p>Caledane's territory in Aldea is inventively called "New
    Caledane", though of course it has many counties. New Caledane does
    not have states or provinces, because it was decreed a crown colony
    by will of the king. Instead, Caledane has appointed governors who
    serve at his majesty's pleasure. Many of these governors are
    noblemen in their own right, however, or wish to be, and the further
    they are from the coast, the more they seek to extract value for
    themselves.</p>
    <h3 id="government">Government</h3>
    <p>The king of New Caledane is Henry III, a bold young man who
    proved himself at the age of 17 by personally traveling to Aldea to
    take command and win the so-called "Little War" with Venetonne. He
    believes in the old ideals of the Caledane nobility: martial valor,
    <em>noblesse oblige</em>, and the timeless bond of reciprocal
    obligations between a ruler, the nobility, and the peasantry. He
    barely understands and hardly trusts the headlong rush toward
    industralization, and is quietly horrified by the new formulation of
    "capitalism" that has come into focus with the reopening of the
    Forbidden Continent.</p>
    <p>Though he has proven himself in battle, Henry is still sometimes
    called the "boy-king" by supporters and opponents alike.</p>
    <p>A coup attempt in 1795 forced King Henry to flee to New Caledane,
    where he was proudly received as true king of Caledane. Since that
    time, emissaries of the Protectorate of Caledane have roundly failed
    to convince any of New Caledane's power brokers to recognize their
    claim to the colony; but King Henry's own emissaries have failed to
    assert the king's power over Caledane. If King Henry is to return to
    the throne in Blueport, it will be through war.</p>
    <p>New Caledane had a provincial government under direct control of
    the king and Parliament. King Henry's first duty upon his arrival
    was to constitute a more durable and just government for his new
    home. At King Henry's explicit request, encouraged by the fiery
    reformer John Nickelbrook, the government of New Caledane has been
    refounded as a representative republic. Since New Caledane's
    colonial governorships were not hereditary titles to begin with,
    this formation was broadly welcomed.</p>
    <p>Under the new government, even the monarchy itself will be a
    lifetime appointment by Parliament, and will be concerned primarily
    with foreign and military affairs.</p>
    <h3 id="crown-city">Crown City</h3>
    <p>TODO. Quick notes</p>
    <ul>
    <li>ruined megacity, basically Hong Kong meets Manhattan</li>
    <li>was patrolled by military warmechs; Caledane battleships
    eventually defeated them with offshore bombardment, after
    losses</li>
    <li>completely pacified and fully explored, population is slowly
    growing</li>
    <li>a layer of 1800s construction covers the bottom two floors of
    the ancient skyscrapers</li>
    <li>neon signs and glitchy advertisements still flash from the sides
    of the skyscrapers and sometimes float in the air as holograms</li>
    <li>so... imagine some Napoleon-era dudes riding a carriage down
    Broadway, between post-apocalyptic skyscraper ruins that have been
    rebuilt to have wood and stone fronts for the first two floors,
    while a glowing glitched-out hologram anime mascot floats in front
    of them trying to sell them an energy drink that hasn't been
    manufactured for thousands of years</li>

    <p>Venetonne's territory in Aldea is called Amarenne, after the
    crown princess at the time, now Queen Amara IV. In the early days of
    colonization, Venetonnian nobles sent expeditions at their own
    expense, and have established city-states or provinces which chafe
    at the external control of the queen.</p>
    <h3 id="caraveda">Caraveda</h3>
    <p>TODO, but in short:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>major city of Amarenne, seat of Venetonnian governance</li>
    <li>has a famous arcanatech artifact, the Great Globe of Caraveda,
    which teaches an essence once every 400 days</li>
    <li>famous for its areas of narrow streets, integrated gardens, and
    comprehensive elevated rail system where cars would hang down from a
    single central rail; it doesn't work anymore, of course, but it
    looks like it was pretty sweet</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-midlands">The Midlands</h2>
    <p>TODO, but in short:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the Midlands is equivalent to the American Midwest, meaning it's
    actually closer to the east coast than the west</li>
    <li>not fully controlled by any one faction, and a fair amount is
    still only kinda controlled; some areas are owned by New Caledane or
    Amarenne or Centramundi on paper, but in reality are run by locals
    (sometimes even warlords)</li>
    <li>half wild, lots of forests and plains where bioengineered
    monsters still roam, but the main civilization areas and roads are
    safe</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="the-house-of-light">The House of Light</h3>
    <p>Before the Third Barrier fell, surveyors eagerly walked the edge
    of the barrier, mapping everything they could see on the other side.
    At night, over the horizon, there was a multicolored glow that was
    assumed to come from a city as large as Crown City or Caraveda. When
    the barrier fell, it was confirmed: unlike Crown City and Caraveda,
    where certain areas and devices still have power, the House of Light
    was illuminated from the curbside all the way up into the heavens.
    Many of its lights and signs and holographic artworks were damaged
    or destroyed by the war, of course, but even the broken ones often
    still cast illumination, leaking brilliant pink and teal and gold
    into the night.</p>
    <p>The House of Light is powered by a generator whose massive runic
    cables were the key to reproducing the cables of the ancients,
    albeit in a much less efficient form.</p>
    <h2 id="the-newlands">The Newlands</h2>
    <p>Centramundi laid claim to a coastal region along the southern
    shore of Aldea, and expanded from there. Since Aldea is to the north
    of Centramundi, the coast is called "The Northern Frontier".</p>
    <p>The official name of Centramundi's Aldean holdings is "the New
    Lands." As proper worshippers of Ammon, the Centramundian
    bureaucracy is not well known for its creativity; perhaps they
    should have let a Scroll Knight name it. Centramundians meticulously
    pronounce all three words, but Broadlanders call it "the
    Newlands."</p>
    <h3 id="north-town">North Town</h3>
    <p>The founding city of the Newlands is called the Northern Capital.
    Broadlanders call it "North Town," often shortened to "Nawthton".
    North Town is a city of majestic buildings of stone and elegantly
    carved wood, reminiscent of the City of Heaven, Centramundi's
    capital. Designed from the very beginning to serve as the
    administrative center of a major new province, North Town feels huge
    and empty, and many districts are no more than carefully surveyed
    plots of perfectly leveled dirt.</p>
    <p>The center of North Town, near the port, is lively, bustling, and
    dense, teeming with people from all over the world. Before the
    reopening of Aldea, travel from Broadland to Centramundi was
    extremely difficult. Now, although the journey still takes nearly
    half a year, it is safe and reliable, and North Town is a major
    waypoint.</p>
    <p>[Loosely based on New Orleans, of course, but with Chinese
    influences instead of French.]</p>
    <h2 id="exmundi">Exmundi</h2>
    <p>Centramundi built their Aldean colonies on the backs of the
    Lowlands tribes, a regional rival they had subjugated centuries ago.
    The Lowlanders in Centramundi were already oppressed, impoverished,
    and rightfully resentful; in Aldea, they were exploited even
    further. The outer reaches of the Newlands were settled by
    Lowlanders, but they were treated as serfs, legally prohibited from
    leaving their assigned farmlands or logging camps.</p>
    <p>They rebelled, successfully, and formed the independent nation of
    Exmundi, which has its heart in a broad valley in the Midlands.
    Caledane and Venetonne have found it to be in their interest to
    support Exmundi, and so the balance of power remains on a knife
    edge.</p>
    <p>In Centramundi, the Lowlanders had long since been forced from
    the most fertile land and forced to subsist on the steppes as horse
    nomads. Not a lifestyle anyone would choose, but they developed a
    culture where every able-bodied soul had to be a herder, ranger, and
    warrior. Think of the various steppe nomads of northern Asia,
    notably the Mongols. On Centramundi, they were kept in check by the
    empire and its god, but on Aldea, they found themselves in a more
    favorable position&mdash;and were shielded from Ammon's attention by the
    protective hand of Amina, the Goddess of Rings.</p>
    <p>As nomads with little love for cities, the Lowlanders of Exmundi
    have chosen to reclaim the traditional way of life which was long
    suppressed by Centramundi. Their new lands are more fruitful than
    their historic ones, so many Lowlanders have become farmers or
    town-dwellers, but Exmundi has also parlayed their legendary riding
    and skirmishing talents into <em>de facto</em> control of most of
    the trade routes through the Midlands. By taking a percentage of all
    trade that passes through their extensive territory, and modifying
    that percentage to favor one interest or another, they have achieved
    economic and political power.</p>
    <p>The Abacus Knights are the enforcement wing of Exmundi's trade
    regulations. While the Scroll Knights of Centramundi are
    warrior-poets, Exmundi's Abacus Knights mockingly call themselves
    warrior-accountants, whose duty is to make sure Exmundi extracts its
    fair share.</p>
    <p>Exmundi is in a good position as of 1800, but not a stable one.
    The Newlands, New Caledane, and Amarenne are all expanding further
    into the Midlands, and their existing holdings will only grow in
    population. In time, Exmundi will face a territorial reckoning.</p>
