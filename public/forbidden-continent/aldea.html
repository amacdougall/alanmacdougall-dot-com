    <p>When mankind was exiled from the Forbidden Continent, its name
    was preserved in myth: Aldea. A land of wonders, homeland of the
    gods, birthplace of mankind. It has always been possible to sail
    across the Great Divide, but the Barriers prevented navigators from
    getting close enough to see Aldea as anything more than a distant
    line on the horizon.</p>
    <p>Crossing the ocean was a dangerous and expensive task, so
    expeditions to view the barrier were not frequent. The First Barrier
    may have fallen any time between 1632 and 1725, but it is commonly
    agreed that the barrier fell between the summer solstices of 1716
    and 1717 (see "Sunmaker", in <a href="gods.html">Gods</a>). In 1725,
    an expedition from Venetonne sailed to the Forbidden Continent, and
    found that the barrier was gone, and the coast was accessible. A few
    days later, captain Luisela Hunter led the first expedition to make
    landfall on Aldea since the War of Breaking.</p>
    <p>Hunter dropped anchor near the flooded city that is now known as
    North Town, on the southeast coast of Aldea. Two boats rowed into
    the heart of the city, but as the crew gaped up at the ruined
    towers, they were massacred by aerial automata that swarmed from the
    windows. An apt welcome to the Forbidden Continent. Hunter retreated
    and tried several points along the shoreline. She was able to take
    on water at a river mouth, but the perils of the Forbidden Continent
    were omnipresent, and finally the expedition was forced to retreat
    back across the Great Divide.</p>
    <p>Better-prepared expeditions from Venetonne chipped away at the
    threats of North Town, while Caledanian ships of the line famously
    dueled the titanic automata of Crown City in a battle of artillery.
    Finally, Venetonne and Caledane founded Le Coeur and Crown City,
    just a few months apart in 1750. Later, Centramundi laid claim to
    the southern mass of Aldea, and Venetonne, unwilling to challenge
    the great power, sold Le Coeur to Centramundi in 1768. (See the
    sections on Crown City, Caraveda, and North Town.)</p>
    <h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
    <p>The eastern coast of the continent was the first to be colonized
    by the great powers. Caledane and Venetonne control the northeast;
    Centramundi controls the southeast. The colonies extend inland, but
    as you travel further west, central authority grows weaker.</p>
    <p>For instance, along the coast, the colonial cities of Caledane
    and Venetonne are ruled by governors&mdash;noblemen, to be sure, but
    accountable to the crown. Further inland, provinces are ruled by
    noblemen who exercise a more personal form of power. And beyond
    those lands, noble estates grow more rare, and the wilderness more
    dangerous, and before long, power is to be found only at the end of
    a gun-barrel. Settlers, trappers, prospectors, and treasure hunters,
    all exist in an uneasy truce which lasts only as long as there is
    plenty for all.</p>
    <p>The same pattern applies to the more southerly holdings of
    Centramundi, but for different reasons. "Heaven is wide, and the
    emperor is far away," says a common proverb. A minister of the state
    must obey the imperial edict: each sealed scroll represents the very
    will of Ammon. But these orders are broadly strategic, and the
    ministers are left to decide upon the details, with varying results;
    and of course, the difficulty of travel and communication makes it
    impossible to project the full weight of imperial authority out to
    the very frontier.</p>
    <h2 id="ruins-of-the-ancients">Ruins of the Ancients</h2>
    <p>The ruins of the ancient civilization are everywhere in
    Aldea.</p>
    <p>TODO, but in brief, expect the world to be a ruined shell of a
    magic-based sci-fi slightly-cyberpunk version of the future. Imagine
    Final Fantasy (7, 10, 13, and 15, to be exact) crossed with Blade
    Runner. The omnipresent ruins in Horizon: Zero Dawn are another good
    point of reference.</p>
    <p>This is a post-apocalypse, but verdant and nature-filled one.
    When you imagine a ruin, imagine it largely reclaimed by native
    plants and animals.</p>
    <p><em>Also</em> imagine that it is filled with deadly reminders of
    the War of Breaking. Ancient war robots, immortal beasts¹ that exist
    only to kill humans, deadly permanent spell effects, traps, poisons,
    and so on.</p>
    <p>Some (usually ruined) things that are omnipresent, and you should
    remind me about them:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>highway systems and railroad tracks; in civilized areas, these
    are often being repaired to serve their old purpose again</li>
    <li>towns everywhere two highways intersect, or along rivers, or
    wherever it would make sense</li>
    <li>houses even in rural areas</li>
    <li>wrecked vehicles, especially aircraft, tanks, destroyed robots,
    etc; "turn left on the dirt track, and if you see a big ol' metal
    arm sticking up out of the ground, you went too far"</li>
    <li>bridges, often collapsed, but their pilings and ruins remain and
    are often the basis of newly constructed bridges made of wood or
    whatever</li>
    <li>metal towers holding power or communication lines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The level of ruination is realistically gonna be more like 100
    years than thousands. GPT-4 gave me <a
    href="https://gist.github.com/amacdougall/839b99e7807b31f52be5278bf17eca94">an
    answer that seemed pretty reasonable</a> suggesting that after 3000
    years, very little would remain. But that's not nearly as cool as
    reinhabiting a bunch of mostly-recognizable ruins, so I'm going to
    handwave that things are pretty well preserved by, you know, the
    will of the gods.</p>
    <p><small> ¹ You know all the things in the Monster Manual where you
    say, "why would this even exist?" </small></p>
    <h3 id="reclamation-speed">Reclamation Speed</h3>
    <p>Highly variable. Everywhere in Aldea, there's a whole menagerie
    of immortal bionengineered cybernetic monsters, war robots following
    search and destroy programming, traps, permanent spell effects like
    walls of fire or areas of reversed gravity.... but obviously the
    quantity and degree of danger depends on the location.</p>
    <p>For example, let's take the fall of the Third Barrier, which
    revealed most of the Midlands.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>After a few weeks:</strong> Heavily armed explorers had
    scouted out the locations of the biggest prizes, such as the city
    called the House of Lights, and a completely intact skyscraper
    called the Crystal Tower.</li>
    <li><strong>After a few months:</strong> The armies of Amarenne and
    New Caledane had cleared the fields and forests closest to civilized
    land, and settlers started to move in. Ruined towns were being
    cleared and looted of their everyday treasures.</li>
    <li><strong>After a few years:</strong> Amarenne and New Caledane
    had footholds in the House of Lights, and villages and towns were
    being rebuilt and repopulated by modern folk.</li>
    <li><strong>After a decade:</strong> Large parts of the House of
    Lights were made safe, and the research camps became boom towns for
    adventurers diving into the buildings and basements of the city.
    Exmundi and the League fought for control of the valuable trade
    routes that had opened up now that the entire Amparo River was
    uncovered.</li>
    <li><strong>Even now, after twenty years:</strong> Several sites in
    the House of Lights are still deadly dangerous, patrolled by
    monsters or automata that have repelled every attack. The Crystal
    Tower remains completely inviolate, defended by a single metal titan
    nicknamed "Billy."</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="ancient-aldean-society">Ancient Aldean Society</h2>
    <p>TODO, but we probably have a mix of records. For a long time,
    Aldea was tranquil and prosperous, but in the decade leading up to
    the War of Breaking, and especially the War itself, people were
    understandably pretty stressed out. The gods have hidden why the war
    began or how it was fought; diary entries or scrying-glass
    soliloquies are heavily censored by the same divine will that hides
    the other ancient secrets.</p>
    <h2 id="the-war-of-breaking">The War of Breaking</h2>
    <p>TODO, but we have very little information. We don't know what the
    sides were or what causes they fought over. We know only that it was
    a war of unrestrained savagery, which was ended only when Sunmaker,
    the father of the gods, returned from a long voyage to witness the
    destruction his children had wrought.</p>
    <h2 id="new-caledane">New Caledane</h2>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/aldea/aldea_ship_near_city_01.png"
    alt="An arcanatech-augmented sailing ship leaving port." />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>An arcanatech-augmented sailing
    ship leaving port.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Caledane's territory in Aldea is inventively called "New
    Caledane", though of course it has many counties. New Caledane does
    not have states or provinces, because it was decreed a crown colony
    by will of the king. Instead, Caledane has appointed governors who
    serve at his majesty's pleasure. Many of these governors are
    noblemen in their own right, however, or wish to be, and the further
    they are from the coast, the more they seek to extract value for
    themselves.</p>
    <h3 id="government">Government</h3>
    <p>The king of New Caledane is Henry III, a bold young man who
    proved himself at the age of sixteen by personally traveling to
    Aldea to take command and win the so-called "Little War" with
    Venetonne. He believes in the old ideals of the Caledane nobility:
    martial valor, <em>noblesse oblige</em>, and the timeless bond of
    reciprocal obligations between a ruler, the nobility, and the
    peasantry. He barely understands and hardly trusts the headlong rush
    toward industralization, and is quietly horrified by the new
    formulation of "capitalism" that has come into focus with the
    reopening of the Forbidden Continent.</p>
    <p>Now twenty-four years of age, Henry is still called the
    "boy-king" by supporters and opponents alike.</p>
    <p>A coup attempt in 1795 forced King Henry to flee to New Caledane,
    where he was proudly received as true king of Caledane. Since that
    time, emissaries of the Protectorate of Caledane have roundly failed
    to convince any of New Caledane's power brokers to recognize their
    claim to the colony; but King Henry's own emissaries have failed to
    assert the king's power over Caledane. If King Henry is to return to
    the throne in Blueport, it will be through war.</p>
    <p>New Caledane had a provincial government under direct control of
    the king and Parliament. King Henry's first duty upon his arrival
    was to constitute a more durable and just government for his new
    home. At King Henry's explicit request, encouraged by the fiery
    reformer John Nickelbrook, the government of New Caledane has been
    refounded as a representative republic. Since New Caledane's
    colonial governorships were not hereditary titles to begin with,
    this formation was broadly welcomed.</p>
    <p>Under the new government, even the monarchy itself will be a
    lifetime appointment by Parliament, and will be concerned primarily
    with foreign and military affairs.</p>
    <h3 id="crown-city">Crown City</h3>
    <p>TODO. Quick notes</p>
    <ul>
    <li>ruined megacity, basically Hong Kong meets Manhattan</li>
    <li>was patrolled by military warmechs; Caledane battleships
    eventually defeated them with offshore bombardment, after
    losses</li>
    <li>completely pacified and fully explored, population is slowly
    growing</li>
    <li>a layer of 1800s construction covers the bottom two floors of
    the ancient skyscrapers</li>
    <li>neon signs and glitchy advertisements still flash from the sides
    of the skyscrapers and sometimes float in the air as holograms</li>
    <li>so... imagine some Napoleon-era dudes riding a carriage down
    Broadway, between post-apocalyptic skyscraper ruins that have been
    rebuilt to have wood and stone fronts for the first two floors,
    while a glowing glitched-out hologram anime mascot floats in front
    of them trying to sell them an energy drink that hasn't been
    manufactured for thousands of years</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="amarenne">Amarenne</h2>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>Venetonne's territory in Aldea is called Amarenne, after the
    crown princess at the time, now Queen Amara IV. In the early days of
    colonization, Venetonnian nobles sent expeditions at their own
    expense, and have established city-states or provinces which chafe
    at the external control of the queen.</p>
    <h3 id="caraveda">Caraveda</h3>
    <p>TODO, but in short:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>major city of Amarenne, seat of Venetonnian governance</li>
    <li>has a famous arcanatech artifact, the Great Globe of Caraveda,
    which teaches an essence once every 400 days</li>
    <li>famous for its areas of narrow streets, integrated gardens, and
    comprehensive elevated rail system where cars would hang down from a
    single central rail; it doesn't work anymore, of course, but it
    looks like it was pretty sweet</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-midlands">The Midlands</h2>
    <p>TODO, but in short:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>was covered by the Third Barrier until 1780</li>
    <li>the Midlands is equivalent to the American Midwest, meaning it's
    actually closer to the east coast than the west</li>
    <li>not fully controlled by any one faction, and a fair amount is
    still only kinda controlled; some areas are owned by New Caledane or
    Amarenne or Centramundi on paper, but in reality are run by locals
    (sometimes even warlords)</li>
    <li>half wild, lots of forests and plains where bioengineered
    monsters still roam, but the main civilization areas and roads are
    safe</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="the-house-of-light">The House of Light</h3>
    <p>Before the Third Barrier fell, surveyors eagerly walked the edge
    of the barrier, mapping everything they could see on the other side.
    At night, over the horizon, there was a multicolored glow that was
    assumed to come from a city as large as Crown City or Caraveda. When
    the barrier fell in 1780, it was confirmed: unlike Crown City and
    Caraveda, where certain areas and devices still have power, the
    House of Light was illuminated from the curbside all the way up into
    the heavens. Many of its lights and signs and holographic artworks
    were damaged or destroyed by the war, of course, but even the broken
    ones often still cast illumination, leaking brilliant pink and teal
    and gold into the night.</p>
    <p>The House of Light is powered by a generator whose massive runic
    cables were the key to reproducing the cables of the ancients,
    albeit in a much less efficient form.</p>
    <p>The House of Light is home to two militarized research camps
    established by New Caledane and Amarenne. Even twenty years after
    the fall of the barrier, the city is not entirely safe.</p>
    <h3 id="the-crystal-tower">The Crystal Tower</h3>
    <p>TODO, but it's a completely intact skyscraper guarded by a
    titanic warmech nicknamed "Billy" because the shape of its head
    reminds people of the crown of King William the Conqueror, of
    Caledane. All attempts to destroy, disable, avoid, or circumvent
    Billy have failed. Every time someone tries a new tactic, Billy
    displays a new capability.</p>
    <h2 id="the-newlands">The Newlands</h2>
    <p>Centramundi laid claim to a coastal region along the southern
    shore of Aldea, and expanded from there. Since Aldea is to the north
    of Centramundi, the coast is called "The Northern Frontier".</p>
    <p>The official name of Centramundi's Aldean holdings is "the New
    Lands." As proper worshippers of Ammon, the Centramundian
    bureaucracy is not well known for its creativity; perhaps they
    should have let a Scroll Knight name it. Centramundians meticulously
    pronounce all three words, but Broadlanders call it "the
    Newlands."</p>
    <h3 id="north-town">North Town</h3>
    <p>The founding city of the Newlands is called the Northern Capital.
    Broadlanders call it "North Town," often shortened to "Nawthton".
    Like most cities in Aldea, it is built in the ruins of a much larger
    ancient city, which the ancients called <em>Ceverell</em>. The city
    is flooded as a result of the War of Breaking, with most buildings
    submerged at least one story below the waterline. It is common to
    dimly see glowing signs underwater, advertising businesses abandoned
    for thousands of years. Its citizens live in the ancient buildings,
    whose interiors have been rebuilt, and travel between them using
    soaring wooden walkways or slim canal boats.</p>
    <p>The center of North Town, near the port, was originally rebuilt
    by Venetonne, and still goes by the name "Le Coeur". Even as
    Centramundi builds up the rest of the city along their own ideals of
    harmony and balance, Le Coeur retains its character. It is lively,
    bustling, and dense, teeming with people from all over the world.
    Where the wooden walkways of Centramundian architecture are
    varnished but otherwise natural, the bridges and walkways of Le
    Coeur are colored like the rainbow, with paint that is already
    peeling in the humidity and salt spray. The children and
    grandchildren of the original Venetonnian settlers call themselves
    "Venemundians," which quickly shortened to "Venmun-jens" and then
    "Venjuns".</p>
    <p>Before the reopening of Aldea, travel from Broadland to
    Centramundi was extremely difficult. Now, although the journey still
    takes nearly half a year, it is safe and reliable, and North Town is
    a major waypoint.</p>
    <p>[Loosely based on New Orleans, of course.]</p>
    <h4 id="location-and-history">Location and History</h4>
    <p>Built on a humid delta at the mouth of the Amparo, North Town has
    a good geographic position for commerce with the interior of the
    continent. It has productive fisheries and terrain well suited for
    agriculture.</p>
    <p>North Town was originally settled by Venetonne as "Le Coeur", a
    sentimental nod to Aldea as humanity's birthplace.</p>
    <p>When Centramundi began to settle the southern coast of Aldea, and
    Venetonne's northern settlement of Caraveda was well established,
    Venetonne found it easy to accept Centramundi's offer of a buyout.
    In 1768, Le Coeur became "the Northern Capital."</p>
    <h2 id="exmundi">Exmundi</h2>
    <p>Centramundi built their Aldean colonies on the backs of the
    Lowlands tribes, a regional rival they had subjugated centuries ago.
    The Lowlanders in Centramundi were already oppressed, impoverished,
    and rightfully resentful; in Aldea, they were exploited even
    further. The outer reaches of the Newlands were settled by
    Lowlanders, but they were treated as serfs, legally prohibited from
    leaving their assigned farmlands or logging camps.</p>
    <p>They rebelled, successfully, and formed the independent nation of
    Exmundi, which has its heart in a broad valley in the Midlands.
    Caledane and Venetonne have found it to be in their interest to
    support Exmundi, and so the balance of power remains on a knife
    edge.</p>
    <p>In Centramundi, the Lowlanders had long since been forced from
    the most fertile land and forced to subsist on the steppes as horse
    nomads. Not a lifestyle anyone would choose, but they developed a
    culture where every able-bodied soul had to be a herder, ranger, and
    warrior. Think of the various steppe nomads of northern Asia,
    notably the Mongols. On Centramundi, they were kept in check by the
    empire and its god, but on Aldea, they found themselves in a more
    favorable position&mdash;and were shielded from Ammon's attention by the
    protective hand of Amina, the Goddess of Rings.</p>
    <p>As nomads with little love for cities, the Lowlanders of Exmundi
    have chosen to reclaim the traditional way of life which was long
    suppressed by Centramundi. Their new lands are more fruitful than
    their historic ones, so many Lowlanders have become farmers or
    town-dwellers, but Exmundi has also parlayed their legendary riding
    and skirmishing talents into <em>de facto</em> control of most of
    the trade routes through the Midlands. By taking a percentage of all
    trade that passes through their extensive territory, and modifying
    that percentage to favor one interest or another, they have achieved
    economic and political power.</p>
    <p>The Abacus Knights are the enforcement wing of Exmundi's trade
    regulations. While the Scroll Knights of Centramundi are
    warrior-poets, Exmundi's Abacus Knights mockingly call themselves
    warrior-accountants, whose duty is to make sure Exmundi extracts its
    fair share.</p>
    <p>Exmundi is in a good position as of 1800, but not a stable one.
    The Newlands, New Caledane, and Amarenne are all expanding further
    into the Midlands, and their existing holdings will only grow in
    population. In time, Exmundi will face a territorial reckoning.</p>
