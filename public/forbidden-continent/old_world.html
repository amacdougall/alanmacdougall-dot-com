    <p>Broadland is a continent whose many rivers and mountain
    ranges&mdash;and variety of bickering gods&mdash;supported sharp distinctions
    between cultures for thousands of years. It is loosely modeled on
    Europe.</p>
    <h2 id="caledane">Caledane</h2>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/old_world/caledane/caledane_idyllic_01.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>Pronounced 'KAL-uh-dane'. Loosely modeled on Great Britain.</p>
    <p>Caledane has existed in something like its current form for 700
    years. Before that, it was united with its rival Venetonne as a
    single kingdom, under the divine patronage of Antonius and Maravia.
    When that holy power couple split up, so did the countries. Alcesta
    I was the founding queen of Caledane, and her family has ruled ever
    since.</p>
    <p>The culture prides itself on pragmatism, determination, and a
    sort of classist egalitarianism that inspires commoners to support
    their wise and just nobles, while the nobles praise and reward the
    good works of the commoners. "A hardworking and ingenious farmer is
    as good as any duke, or better" is a sentiment often expressed,
    seldom acted upon.</p>
    <p>Beer, wheat, and beef are points of national pride, and Caledane
    is famous for wrapping virtually any ingredient in pastry and
    calling it a pie.</p>
    <p>The colors of Caledane are red and white. Its symbol is the
    eagle. Its flag is a red eagle between two horizontal red stripes,
    on a field of white.</p>
    <p>The patron goddess of Caledane is Maravia, Goddess of War.</p>
    <h3 id="geography">Geography</h3>
    <p>Caledane is known for its many small swift rivers and low
    mountain ranges, which complicate travel, but create many sheltered
    fertile valleys. Caledane is in the northwest of Broadland,
    separated from its longtime rival Venetonne by a river in one part,
    a mountain range in another, and by nothing more than political
    agreements at the center.</p>

    <p>The capital city of Caledane is Blueport, a major center of
    commerce, finance, and culture. Often called the capital of the
    world. Port of departure for many ships sailing to Aldea.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>North of Caledane, a few hours by rail, is Stonebridge, once the
    summer court of the king. Now, although carefully maintained by an
    army of servants, Stonebridge lies empty.</p>
    <p>Northern Caledane is called Bradensreach. Centuries ago, it was
    home to barbarians who resisted the Caledanian kings. The "Reachmen"
    still have a reputation as hard-drinking rough and ready wilderness
    warriors. [Think Scotland.]</p>

    background]</p>
    <h3 id="government">Government</h3>
    <p>In 1795, the ongoing industrial revolution led to a workers'
    strike at the Barleyvale Ironworks, which concluded in an infamous
    massacre when the army was sent to break the strike. During the
    strike, the workers learned of a conspiracy to supplant the king,
    leading to a brief civil war. The king fled to New Caledane,
    inAldea, and rules there in exile. Caledane is governed, barely, by
    the Protectorate, a group of squabbling noblemen who have thus far
    failed to declare a Lord Protector.</p>
    <p>The faction which opposed the king is called the Friends of
    Society, a modernizing, capitalistic, trade-friendly group of
    nobles. They claim that rapid industrial expansion will benefit all
    of society, but of course they are also well positioned to reap the
    rewards of the glorious future they predict. They wear top hats and
    tailcoats in the newest fashion, to indicate their position at the
    forefront of Progress.</p>
    <p>To the extent that the Friends have a leader, it is Baron Andrew
    of Brownswell, who narrowly escaped being killed in the initial
    explosion of violence after the Barleyvale Massacre.</p>
    <p>The faction which supported the king is called the Companions of
    the King. They were true believers in the old feudal system, where
    nobles and peasants had reciprocal responsibilities and people lived
    in harmony and prosperity. (The peasants may have had a different
    viewpoint on matters.)</p>
    <p>Although the king was forced to flee to New Caledane, the
    Companions could have easily ruined the country by forcing a
    protracted civil war. The Friends of Society forestalled that move
    by negotiating a peace in which every member of the nobility
    retained their property and privileges. The Companions persist,
    then, as a minority faction in the Parliament of the
    Protectorate.</p>
    <p>The Companions are led by Countess Ophelia of Blue River, after
    the king's advisor Duke Lloyd went with him to New Caledane.</p>
    <h3 id="names">Names</h3>
    <p>Last names in Caledane tend to be based on locations, structures,
    or natural features. Highcastle, Cragmoor, Waterside, Blackholm,
    Ravensfield, Willowbrook, Farwell.</p>
    <p>Bradensreach uses these names, but also uses names of saints:
    "Roderick St. James" would be a stereotypical Reachman name.</p>

    <h4 id="john-the-pretender">John the Pretender</h4>
    <p>John Harcourt, an unrecognized son of the late King Godfrey and a
    minor noblewoman named Guinevere of Sylvandale. He was adopted by
    Guinevere's family, the Harcourts, who had been a regional power in
    the north of Caledane for generations. For genealogical reasons too
    obtuse to detail, Guinevere was arguably a member of the royal line,
    and if recognized, John would have had a claim to the throne by
    primogeniture.</p>
    <p>Royal claims are a matter of political power. Birthright is
    simply a supporting detail. When King Godfrey passed away in 1771,
    leaving behind an infant King Henry who was only a few months old,
    John pressed his claim, supported by the Harcourts and opportunistic
    allies. He was opposed by Duke Lloyd, Henry's regent and now one of
    the king's most trusted advisors.</p>
    <p>There are two routes to usurpation, as amply demonstrated by the
    chaotic history of Venetonne: coups and wars. The Harcourts
    attempted a coup, and when it failed, the elder Harcourts
    surrendered rather than risk a war. The entire family was exiled to
    the Forbidden Continent, driven into the wilderness with one
    wagonload of supplied just as the Third Barrier dropped in 1772. It
    was a death sentence. They were never heard from again.</p>
    <p>As a small act of mercy, the Harcourts younger than ten were
    adopted by loyal noble families, and made to change their names and
    forget the folly of their parents.</p>
    <h2 id="venetonne">Venetonne</h2>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/old_world/venetonne/venetonne_town_01.png"
    alt="A bustling town near Montaigne." />
    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>A bustling town near

    </figure>
    <p>Pronounced 'ven-uh-TAHN'. Loosely modeled on France and
    Spain.</p>
    <p>The culture prides itself on el√°n, flair, and intuition. The
    nobility is obviously endowed with all three, and so their dominion
    is unquestioned. By them, at least.</p>
    <p>Centuries of high-handed oppression, ranging from extractive
    taxation to actual slavery, have created a bubbling undercurrent of
    despair and rage among the peasantry. Four times in the last century
    alone, there have been armed rebellions in areas where the noble
    foot has trod most heavily. Fortunately, Venetonne is watched over
    by the God of Love, whose divine compassion and wisdom have always
    convinced the peasants to set aside their grievances and return
    peacefully to work.</p>
    <p>Venetonne is famous for its elegant and refined cuisine (for the
    rich), its elaborate music (for the rich), and its fine tailoring
    and fashion (for the rich).</p>

    <p>It is also infamous for its political instability. In the 700
    years since Caledane and Venetonne split into separate nations,
    there have been over a dozen ruling dynasties and even three
    different schismatic churches of Antonius, resulting in countless
    coups, civil wars, and factional squabbles. In the last 50 years,
    Queen Amara has introduced an unusual stability, in part by feeding
    her political rivals to the firing squad. "Peace," she is known to
    say, "smells like gunpowder."</p>
    <p>The colors of Venetonne are blue, white, and gold. Its flag is a
    golden sun on a horizontal blue-white-blue tricolor. Its national
    symbol is the sun.</p>
    <p>Venetonne is ruled by Queen Amara IV, who was 12 when the first
    colony was established. She is now 62, and has maintained her grip
    on power with cunning and brutality.</p>
    <p>The divine patron of Venetonne is Antonius, God of Love.</p>
    <h3 id="geography-1">Geography</h3>
    <p>Venetonne is a country of unbroken farmland dotted with forests
    which are carefully managed to be sustainable sources of firewood
    and game.</p>
    <p>The capital city of Venetonne is Montaigne [yeah, after Michel de
    Montaigne, I just like that guy]. Called the "City of Song," it is a
    center of fine culture on the continent. The broad Sky River
    connects it to the seaport city of Marvasse. Marvasse, along with
    Blueport and Telmeria, is one of the three great trading centers of
    Broadland.</p>

    <h3 id="names-1">Names</h3>
    <p>Venetonne and Caledane are both stratified societies, with clear
    and unbridgeable gaps between rich and poor. In Venetonne, even
    surnames are divided by class.</p>
    <p>Lower-class Venetonnians are named after their job, or a family
    profession: Weaver, Baker, Miller.</p>
    <p>There's a "social middle class" who can claim a family history of
    military service or even minor noble blood. Many of them are just as
    poor as the lower class, but some are well-off, through business or
    as noble retainers. These families have heroic names like Lightfoot,
    Braveheart, Strongbow.</p>
    <p>Actual nobility takes the name of their lands: "of Graveria," "of
    North Felton."</p>
    <p>As in Caledane, the ongoing industrial revolution is undermining
    the social system, but for now, the powerful have captured their
    customary share of the profits.</p>
    <h2 id="centramundi">Centramundi</h2>
    <p>Despite the Latinate name, loosely modeled on China. After all,
    it means "center of the world," just like China's traditional name
    of "middle kingdom."</p>
    <p>Under the influence of Ammon, the God of Order, Centramundi has a
    powerful centralized government whose complex hierarchy is ruled by
    an absolute monarch, and ultimately by Ammon itself. Government
    positions are awarded to those who score well on a comprehensive
    examination. Centramundi has universal childhood education, and
    nearly 100% literacy, so although the well-off can hire tutors for
    their own children, the bureaucracy is a major engine of social
    mobility.</p>
    <p>Although Centramundi emphasizes the rewards of education, this
    should not be confused for innovation. Conformity and adherence to
    procedure are highly prized, and creativity is seldom encouraged. In
    the years since the reopening of the Forbidden Continent, new
    technologies have been introduced to Broadland at a rapid rate.
    Ammon has granted its people knowledge of the same technologies, as
    quickly as they arrive, but the god's intent is to maintain parity,
    not to leapfrog the competition.</p>
    <p>The people of Broadland mock the Centramundian obsession with
    order and geometry, and sometimes call its inhabitants "triangles"
    or "squares."</p>
    <h3 id="geography-2">Geography</h3>
    <p>Centramundi is a very large nation that occupies its entire small
    continent. The land is broad and flat, with a few wide, slow, easily
    navigable rivers that greatly influenced its development patterns.
    Ideal for rice agriculture, Centramundi supports a comparatively
    higher population per square foot than Broadland, and in fact, rice
    exports to Broadland have become a significant business.</p>
    <p>Its capital is the City of Heaven, at the mouth of the mighty
    River of Life, where it meets the sea. The emperor rules from the
    monolithic Tower of Heaven. The light of Ammon can be seen shining
    from its uppermost windows at night, when the emperor receives the
    god's wisdom.</p>
    <h3 id="scroll-knights">Scroll Knights</h3>
    <p>Centramundi's elite warriors are the Scroll Knights, a society of
    warrior poets. Each Scroll Knight writes a sonnet to be read aloud
    in the case of their death in battle, and carries it in the scroll
    case which gives the order its name.</p>
    <h3 id="names-2">Names</h3>
    <p>Centramundi only had intermittent contact with the rest of the
    world before the opening of Aldea, and although the gods agreed to
    prevent linguistic drift after the War of Breaking, Centramundian
    first names sound strange to Broadland ears: Jamis, Adiron, Buckner,
    Omech; Kisana, Catrin, Shalira, Tamryn. [i.e. "fantasy names" that
    still sound mostly European]</p>
    <p>Centramundian surnames are based on animals: White Owl, Stalking
    Wolf, Old Ram. They don't have to be two words: "Kadira Gazelle"
    could be a Centramundian name. But they are usually two words,
    because in a region with a lot of gazelles and a lot of Kadiras, you
    need an extra layer of disambiguation.</p>
    <h2 id="tbd">TBD</h2>
    <p>There are other major powers in the world, but for now these are
    the three with the most developed presence on Aldea.</p>
    <h1 id="minor-powers">Minor Powers</h1>
    <h2 id="the-mercantile-league-of-telmeria">The Mercantile League of
    Telmeria</h2>
    <p>Often just called "The League," this coalition of traders and
    merchants is based in the small port city-state of Telmeria.
    Telmeria was a regional power for centuries, simply by its
    geographic location on the southern coast of Broadland, but with the
    opening of Aldea, Telmeria has gained global influence. The colonies
    of Caledane, Venetonne, and Centramundi were financed by the
    nobility or the crown&mdash;the merchants of Telmeria invented the
    joint-stock corporation. The other great powers tried to grab
    natural resources and plunder the ancient knowledge of the ruins&mdash;the
    merchants of Telmeria moved quickly to lay claim to strategic points
    on shipping routes.</p>
    <p>Seeing the value of mutual defense and trade, the Telmeria
    corporations formed the League, and before long, they had merged
    into a single corporation in name and law. Wielding "the cannon and
    the coin as sword and shield," the League has been able to carve out
    a position of power in the gaps between the larger powers.</p>
    <p>The League has no dedicated divine patron, but they pay great
    honor to Tara, the Goddess of Learning, and Anaxarchus, the God of
    Storms.</p>
    <p>[Telmeria is loosely based on the Netherlands and its
    Amsterdam-based mercantile empire.]</p>
