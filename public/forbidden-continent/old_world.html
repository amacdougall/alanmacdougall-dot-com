    <h1 id="the-old-world">The Old World</h1>
    <p>Broadland is a continent whose many rivers and mountain
    ranges&mdash;and variety of bickering gods&mdash;supported sharp distinctions
    between cultures for thousands of years. It is loosely modeled on
    Europe.</p>
    <h2 id="caledane">Caledane</h2>
    <p>Pronounced 'KAL-uh-dane'. Loosely modeled on Great Britain.</p>
    <p>Caledane has existed in something like its current form for 700
    years. Before that, it was united with its rival Venetonne as a
    single kingdom, under the divine patronage of Antonius and Maravia.
    When that holy power couple split up, so did the countries. Alcesta
    I was the founding queen of Caledane, and her family has ruled ever
    since.</p>
    <p>The culture prides itself on pragmatism, determination, and a
    sort of classist egalitarianism that inspires commoners to support
    their wise and just nobles, while the nobles praise and reward the
    good works of the commoners. "A hardworking and ingenious farmer is
    as good as any duke, or better" is a sentiment often expressed,
    seldom acted upon.</p>
    <p>The ongoing industrial revolution is putting the traditional
    aristocratic system in some danger, but for now, the aristocrats and
    their cronies have kept on top of things.</p>
    <p>Beer, wheat, and beef are points of national pride, and Caledane
    is famous for wrapping virtually any ingredient in pastry and
    calling it a pie.</p>
    <p>The colors of Caledane are red and white. Its symbol is the
    eagle. Its flag is a red eagle between two horizontal red stripes,
    on a field of white.</p>
    <h3 id="geography">Geography</h3>
    <p>Caledane is known for its many small swift rivers and low
    mountain ranges, which complicate travel, but create many sheltered
    fertile valleys. Caledane is in the northwest of Broadland,
    separated from its longtime rival Venetonne by a river in one part,
    a mountain range in another, and by nothing more than political
    agreements at the center.</p>
    <p>The capital city of Caledane is Blueport, a major center of
    commerce, finance, and culture. Often called the capital of the
    world. Port of departure for many ships sailing to Aldea.</p>
    <figure>

    <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><em>Blueport, Capital of the
    World</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Northern Caledane is called Bradensreach. Centuries ago, it was
    home to barbarians who resisted the Caledanian kings. The "Reachmen"
    still have a reputation as hard-drinking rough and ready wilderness
    warriors. [Think Scotland.]</p>
    <p>[feel free to come up with more regions if it's helpful for your
    background]</p>
    <h3 id="government">Government</h3>
    <p>The king of Caledane is Henry III, a bold young man who proved
    himself by personally traveling to Aldea to take command and win the
    most recent minor war with Venetonne. He believes in the old ideals
    of the Caledane nobility: martial valor, <em>noblesse oblige</em>,
    and the timeless bond of reciprocal obligations between a ruler, the
    nobility, and the peasantry. He barely understands and hardly trusts
    the headlong rush toward industralization, and is quietly horrified
    by the new formulation of "capitalism" that has come into focus with
    the reopening of the Forbidden Continent.</p>
    <p>Though he has proven himself in battle, Henry is still sometimes
    called the "boy-king" by supporters and opponents alike.</p>
    <p>King Henry is supported by a majority of Parliament, but his
    supporters are supporting their personal interests: they are
    landholders who live in country estates by the labor of their tenant
    farmers and artisans. The rural economy is the heart of the king's
    power and his power base. Until about a century ago, urban centers
    were a sliver of economic output throughout all of Broadland. In
    1800, industry makes up 25% of the economy and is growing rapidly.
    Not all of the king's supporters realize that they are engaged in a
    factional battle. Those who do realize this have formed loose bonds,
    and call themselves the Companions of the Crown.</p>
    <p>King Henry and his coalition are opposed by a modernizing,
    capitalistic, trade-friendly group of nobles who call themselves the
    Friends of Society. They claim that rapid industrial expansion and
    scientific advancement will benefit all of society, and they may
    even believe it, but they have also positioned themselves to reap
    the rewards of the new order, standing shoulder to shoulder with the
    rising class of commonborn industrialists. This faction is led by
    Duke Marcus of Falchester.</p>
    <p>In Parliament, the Companions have taken to wearing a red and
    white ribbon, the colors of Caledane. Rather than respond in kind,
    the Friends have begun wearing modern tailcoats and top hats to
    Parliament rather than the aristocratic three-quarter coats and lace
    ruffs of old.</p>
    <h3 id="names">Names</h3>
    <p>Last names in Caledane tend to be based on locations, structures,
    or natural features. Highcastle, Cragmoor, Waterside, Blackholm,
    Ravensfield, Willowbrook, Farwell.</p>
    <p>Bradensreach uses these names, but also uses names of saints:
    "Roderick St. James" would be a stereotypical Reachman name.</p>
    <h3 id="maravia-goddess-of-war">Maravia, Goddess of War</h3>
    <p>Divine patron of Caledane. Maravia represents war in all its
    forms: military conflict, of course, but more generally the act of
    competing against rivals for scarce resources, from international
    diplomacy to political discipline to the struggle for personal
    improvement. A concept this broad is easy to operationalize in the
    service of basically any human endeavor, and so the actions of the
    state of often seem to be at odds with a naive conception of
    "war."</p>
    <p>Depiction in religious art: a beautiful but stern woman with a
    brooding watchfulness. Sometimes represented as a mother, usually as
    a warrior. Her armor and weapons change with the era. In modern
    times, she is often depicted wearing a general's hat and leading a
    cavalry charge.</p>
    <p>Divine regalia: A halo whose rays of light are swords. Red and
    white cloth. Golden armor. A rose whose thorns draw blood. When she
    manifests, those small drops of blood are preserved as holy
    relics.</p>
    <p>Holy symbols: A red teardrop, symbolizing blood. A golden sword,
    or a golden shield; or, lately, a golden firearm. Her priesthood can
    be recognized by a certain pattern of white with thin red stripes;
    it's as distinctive as a Catholic priest's collar.</p>
    <h3 id="historical-notes-on-caledane">Historical Notes on
    Caledane</h3>
    <p>1771: Henry III is born; Godfrey VII dies; John the Pretender is
    exiled 1788: The Little War 1795: The Throne and the Sword 1800:
    Main campaign begins</p>
    <h4 id="john-the-pretender">John the Pretender</h4>
    <p>John Harcourt, an unrecognized son of the late King Godfrey and a
    minor noblewoman named Guinevere of Sylvandale. He was adopted by
    Guinevere's family, the Harcourts, who had been a regional power in
    the north of Caledane for generations. For genealogical reasons too
    obtuse to detail, Guinevere was arguably a member of the royal line,
    and if recognized, John would have had a claim to the throne by
    primogeniture.</p>
    <p>Royal claims are a matter of political power. Birthright is
    simply a supporting detail. When King Godfrey passed away in 1771,
    leaving behind an infant King Henry who was only a few months old,
    John pressed his claim, supported by the Harcourts and opportunistic
    allies. He was opposed by Duke Lloyd, Henry's regent and now one of
    the king's most trusted advisors.</p>
    <p>There are two routes to usurpation, as amply demonstrated by the
    chaotic history of Venetonne: coups and wars. The Harcourts
    attempted a coup, and when it failed, the elder Harcourts
    surrendered rather than risk a war. The entire family was exiled to
    the Forbidden Continent, driven into the wilderness with one
    wagonload of supplied just as the Third Barrier dropped in 1772. It
    was a death sentence. They were never heard from again.</p>
    <p>As a small act of mercy, the Harcourts younger than ten were
    adopted by loyal noble families, and made to change their names and
    forget the folly of their parents.</p>
    <h2 id="venetonne">Venetonne</h2>
    <p>Pronounced 'ven-uh-TAHN'. Loosely modeled on France and
    Spain.</p>
    <p>The culture prides itself on el√°n, flair, and intuition. The
    nobility is obviously endowed with all three, and so their dominion
    is unquestioned. By them, at least.</p>
    <p>Centuries of high-handed oppression, ranging from extractive
    taxation to actual slavery, have created a bubbling undercurrent of
    despair and rage among the peasantry. Four times in the last century
    alone, there have been armed rebellions in areas where the noble
    foot has trod most heavily. Fortunately, Venetonne is watched over
    by the God of Love, whose divine compassion and wisdom have always
    convinced the peasants to set aside their grievances and return
    peacefully to work.</p>
    <p>Venetonne is famous for its elegant and refined cuisine (for the
    rich), its elaborate music (for the rich), and its fine tailoring
    and fashion (for the rich).</p>
    <p>It is also infamous for its political instability. In the 700
    years since Caledane and Venetonne split into separate nations,
    there have been over a dozen ruling dynasties and even three
    different schismatic churches of Antonius, resulting in countless
    coups, civil wars, and factional squabbles. In the last 50 years,
    Queen Amara has introduced an unusual stability, in part by feeding
    her political rivals to the firing squad. "Peace," she is known to
    say, "smells like gunpowder."</p>
    <p>The colors of Venetonne are blue, white, and gold. Its flag is a
    golden sun on a horizontal blue-white-blue tricolor. Its national
    symbol is the sun.</p>
    <p>Venetonne is ruled by Queen Amara IV, who was 12 when the first
    colony was established. She is now 62, and has maintained her grip
    on power with cunning and brutality.</p>
    <h3 id="geography-1">Geography</h3>
    <p>Venetonne is a country of unbroken farmland dotted with forests
    which are carefully managed to be sustainable sources of firewood
    and game.</p>
    <p>The capital city of Venetonne is Montaigne [yeah, after Michel de
    Montaigne, I just like that guy]. Called the "City of Song," it is a
    center of fine culture on the continent. The broad Sky River
    connects it to the seaport city of Marvasse. Marvasse, along with
    Blueport and Telmeria, is one of the three great trading centers of
    Broadland.</p>
    <p>[feel free to make up some regions if it helps your concept]</p>
    <h3 id="names-1">Names</h3>
    <p>Venetonne and Caledane are both stratified societies, with clear
    and unbridgeable gaps between rich and poor. In Venetonne, even
    surnames are divided by class.</p>
    <p>Lower-class Venetonnians are named after their job, or a family
    profession: Weaver, Baker, Miller.</p>
    <p>There's a "social middle class" who can claim a family history of
    military service or even minor noble blood. Many of them are just as
    poor as the lower class, but some are well-off, through business or
    as noble retainers. These families have heroic names like Lightfoot,
    Braveheart, Strongbow.</p>
    <p>Actual nobility takes the name of their lands: "of Graveria," "of
    North Felton."</p>
    <p>As in Caledane, the ongoing industrial revolution is undermining
    the social system, but for now, the powerful have captured their
    customary share of the profits.</p>
    <h3 id="antonius-god-of-love">Antonius, God of Love</h3>
    <p>Divine patron of Venetonne. Antonius represents love in all its
    forms: romantic love, of course, but also the love of a parent for a
    child, or a citizen for their country. A concept this broad is easy
    to operationalize in the service of basically any human endeavor,
    and so the actions of the state often seem to be at odds with a
    naive conception of "love."</p>
    <p>Depiction in religious art: a beautiful young man, almost
    androgynous. Usually represented as a nobleman playing music or at
    the center of a celebration; sometimes shown a wise counselor to a
    king. In modern times, he is often depicted with recent inventions
    or discoveries.</p>
    <p>Divine regalia: A silver implement adorned with a blue sapphire.
    Traditionally a scepter, but recently more modern implements have
    been observed: a pocketwatch, a conductor's wand, a fountain pen,
    even an umbrella. His priesthood is known for grand robes during
    services, and upper-class finery the rest of the time.</p>
    <p>Holy symbols: The religion equates love with the vast and eternal
    sky, so a white circle on a blue field, or a blue circle on a white
    field, are both taken as symbols of Antonius. Likewise, any blue gem
    or stone, such as sapphire or lapis lazuli, usually in a silver
    setting.</p>
    <h2 id="centramundi">Centramundi</h2>
    <p>Despite the Latinate name, loosely modeled on China. After all,
    it means "center of the world," just like China's traditional name
    of "middle kingdom."</p>
    <p>Under the influence of Ammon, the God of Order, Centramundi has a
    powerful centralized government whose complex hierarchy is ruled by
    an absolute monarch, and ultimately by Ammon itself. Government
    positions are awarded to those who score well on a comprehensive
    examination. Centramundi has universal childhood education, and
    nearly 100% literacy, so although the well-off can hire tutors for
    their own children, the bureaucracy is a major engine of social
    mobility.</p>
    <p>Although Centramundi emphasizes the rewards of education, this
    should not be confused for innovation. Conformity and adherence to
    procedure are highly prized, and creativity is seldom encouraged. In
    the years since the reopening of the Forbidden Continent, new
    technologies have been introduced to Broadland at a rapid rate.
    Ammon has granted its people knowledge of the same technologies, as
    quickly as they arrive, but the god's intent is to maintain parity,
    not to leapfrog the competition.</p>
    <p>The people of Broadland mock the Centramundian obsession with
    order and geometry, and sometimes call its inhabitants "triangles"
    or "squares."</p>
    <h3 id="ammon-god-of-order">Ammon, God of Order</h3>
    <p>Divine patron of Centramundi. Ammon makes no claim to represent
    or embody order. Ammon simply enforces order. The rest of the world
    may do what it likes, but if Centramundi is to persist for eternity,
    it must have stability. Often associated with scholarship,
    discipline, and loyalty.</p>
    <p>Depiction in religious art: Uniquely among the gods, Ammon is
    never depicted as any living creature. Instead, Ammon appears as a
    white rectangle or a rectangular prism which casts a piercing
    illumination on its surroundings. Religious texts studiously avoid
    using any gendered language to describe Ammon.</p>
    <p>Holy symbols: Miniature examples of anything related to geometry
    or mathemtics. Protractor, calipers, compass, abacus, slide rule.
    Geometric shapes have picked up complex symbolism over the
    millennia, so people might wear a small gold circle, or triangle, in
    order to convey a host of cultural and political allegiances.
    Through the will of Ammon, these allegiances have never risen to the
    level of factionalism, but they are powerful forces in Centramundian
    society.</p>
    <h3 id="geography-2">Geography</h3>
    <p>Centramundi is a very large nation that occupies its entire small
    continent. The land is broad and flat, with a few wide, slow, easily
    navigable rivers that greatly influenced its development patterns.
    Ideal for rice agriculture, Centramundi supports a comparatively
    higher population per square foot than Broadland, and in fact, rice
    exports to Broadland have become a significant business.</p>
    <p>Its capital is the City of Heaven, at the mouth of the mighty
    River of Life, where it meets the sea. The emperor rules from the
    monolithic Tower of Heaven. The light of Ammon can be seen shining
    from its uppermost windows at night, when the emperor receives the
    god's wisdom.</p>
    <h3 id="scroll-knights">Scroll Knights</h3>
    <p>Centramundi's elite warriors are the Scroll Knights, a society of
    warrior poets. Each Scroll Knight writes a sonnet to be read aloud
    in the case of their death in battle, and carries it in the scroll
    case which gives the order its name.</p>
    <h3 id="names-2">Names</h3>
    <p>Centramundi only had intermittent contact with the rest of the
    world before the opening of Aldea, and although the gods agreed to
    prevent linguistic drift after the War of Breaking, Centramundian
    first names sound strange to Broadland ears: Jamis, Adiron, Buckner,
    Omech; Kisana, Catrin, Shalira, Tamryn. [i.e. "fantasy names" that
    still sound mostly European]</p>
    <p>Centramundian surnames are based on animals: White Owl, Stalking
    Wolf, Old Ram. They don't have to be two words: "Kadira Gazelle"
    could be a Centramundian name. But they are usually two words,
    because in a region with a lot of gazelles and a lot of Kadiras, you
    need an extra layer of disambiguation.</p>
    <h2 id="tbd">TBD</h2>
    <p>There are other major powers in the world, but for now these are
    the three with the most developed presence on Aldea.</p>
    <h1 id="minor-powers">Minor Powers</h1>
    <h2 id="the-mercantile-league-of-telmeria">The Mercantile League of
    Telmeria</h2>
    <p>Often just called "The League," this coalition of traders and
    merchants is based in the small port city-state of Telmeria.
    Telmeria was a regional power for centuries, simply by its
    geographic location on the southern coast of Broadland, but with the
    opening of Aldea, Telmeria has gained global influence. The colonies
    of Caledane, Venetonne, and Centramundi were financed by the
    nobility or the crown&mdash;the merchants of Telmeria invented the
    joint-stock corporation. The other great powers tried to grab
    natural resources and plunder the ancient knowledge of the ruins&mdash;the
    merchants of Telmeria moved quickly to lay claim to strategic points
    on shipping routes.</p>
    <p>Seeing the value of mutual defense and trade, the Telmeria
    corporations formed the League, and before long, they had merged
    into a single corporation in name and law. Wielding "the cannon and
    the coin as sword and shield," the League has been able to carve out
    a position of power in the gaps between the larger powers.</p>
    <p>The League has no dedicated divine patron, but they pay great
    honor to Tara, the Goddess of Learning, and Anaxarchus, the God of
    Storms.</p>
    <p>[Telmeria is loosely based on the Netherlands and its
    Amsterdam-based mercantile empire.]</p>
